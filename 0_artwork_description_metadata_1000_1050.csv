"Capture of the Tripoli by the Enterprise, 1806/12, Thomas Birch","At the turn of the 19th century, conflict arose between the United States of America and the North African Barbary State of Tripoli. President Thomas Jefferson refused to continue to pay tribute or ransom to Tripoli to prevent the pirating of American merchant ships sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. Jefferson dispatched the American ship Enterprise to the Tripolitan waters as a sign of resistance just as Tripoli increased its tribute demands and declared war against the United States. Thomas Birch, an early specialist in maritime painting, captured the battle between the Enterprise and a Tripolitan cruiser in the Mediterranean’s dark, violent waters. The break in the clouds sheds light on this conflict and illuminates Birch’s fine details and precise rendering of these ships.",1000.0,"Artist

"Madawaska—Acadian Light-Heavy, 1940, Marsden Hartley","Late in life, Marsden Hartley returned to his native Maine and produced a series of heroic figure paintings.
Madawaska—Acadian Light-Heavy is one of several studies of athletes that he made for a gymnasium mural. Hartley particularly favored this model, a French-Canadian light heavyweight boxer. He explained, “I have for the first time since 1922 a real live model a magnificent young feller… . His body is so fine and dear I could work almost without end from him.” Hartley delighted in the boxer’s strong physique, exaggerating his anatomy and painting the background a deep red to heighten the impression of his vitality. Hartley’s figure paintings enjoyed great success. Critics in the early 1940s praised them for their depiction
of strong masculinity, willfully ignoring their controversial homoerotic undertones.",1001.0,"Artist

"Untitled XI, 1975, Willem de Kooning","Willem de Kooning is known for emotive, gestural canvases that transcend conventional definitions of figuration and abstraction. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he turned his attention away from painting, instead focusing on sculpture, printmaking, and drawing. In 1975, at the age of 71, de Kooning began one of the most productive periods of painting in his career, quickly completing 20 new, large canvases within 6 months. Untitled XI belongs to this series, which was, with a few exceptions, untitled and chronologically numbered. Moving away from tightly organized compositions, de Kooning used free-flowing brushwork and softened, sensuous hues to liberate form. Here the figurative references that are dominant in his earlier work are nearly lost within a far more lyrical and joyful abstract landscape.",1016.0,"Artist

"In the Magic Mirror, 1934, Paul Klee","In the Magic Mirror reflects the disillusionment that colored much of Paul Klee’s work following the Nazi takeover of Germany in 1933 and the artist’s subsequent move to his native Switzerland.
Illustrating what Klee called his method of ""taking a line for a walk,"" a meandering red line twists and turns down the center of the canvas, delineating the features of a face. The tight curves on the brow suggest the figure is concentrating, while the tension between the nose and mouth, which pull in opposite directions, conveys anxiety. In contrast to the cheerful pink cheeks, the figure’s tear-shaped eyes communicate distress. The thinly painted, ghostly outline of the head and shoulders is in contrast to the crisp rendering of the face. Klee paints the heart, the true creative center, black, thereby suggesting the pall that settled over this figure, and by extension, the artist at this time.",1017.0,"Artist

Lysimachus (r. 323–281 BC), one of Alexander’s companions and bodyguards, used the king’s image on his own coins in order to cast himself in the role of successor and legitimize his claim to the kingdom of Thrace. Alexander, responsible for establishing the conventions of royal portraiture, is depicted in his preferred manner: youthful and clean-shaven, with long locks of hair rising above his forehead and eyes cast upward. Additionally, he is shown with horns curling around his ears. These “horns of Ammon” symbolize Alexander’s claim that he was the son of the Egyptian god Ammon—a claim reportedly confirmed by the oracle at the sanctuary of Zeus-Ammon at Siwa, Egypt.",1024.0,"Culture

He meandered with his camera through the jazz bars, cafés, and restaurants of Saint–Germain–des–Prés, producing a series of photographs that captured the rebellious youth culture of that time, later published as the book Love on the Left Bank. Shot in quick succession, these two street views show police dispersing a crowd of demonstrators and employ an aerial perspective that contrasts starkly with the casual intimacy found in most of Elsken’s images.

The artist linked the starkness of his imagery to his experience as an African American man, later recalling, “Unconsciously it has a lot to do with a sense of alienation … and in all blacks there is an awareness of their isolation from the mainstream of society.” But the uncertainty presented by Desert Forms can also be interpreted more broadly as symptomatic of the modern human condition. The figures are anonymous and disconnected from each other, facing an austere and insecure world.

"Bird Shaped Ewer with Crowned Rider Holding a Bowl, Goryeo dynasty (918–1392), 12th century","The prosperous Goryeo dynasty that gave its name to modern-day Korea produced some of the world’s most esteemed ceramics. Preeminent among these are celadons, whose iron-rich glazes had been refined by Chinese potters to create a subtle range of gray and bluish-green hues. Under the Goryeo court, Korean craftsmen drew upon the Chinese celadon tradition to create wares of unprecedented beauty and ingenuity. The technical refinement and stylistic naiveté of this intricately constructed bird-shaped ewer exemplify a distinctively Korean aesthetic. Whereas the creature’s plump body resembles a duck’s, its head is crowned with a cockscomb. Disproportionately small wings project out as if in flight, while the tail swoops upward to form a reticulated handle that supports a man who stands atop the bird’s back, holding a bowl. His elaborate headdress and long, flowing robe suggest that he represents an immortal. Details of his garments, as well as of the bird’s overlapping scales and layered feathers, were finely carved and incised into the clay body before glazing and firing; areas where the glaze naturally pooled appear a slightly deeper green. As a final touch, dots of underglaze iron brown accent the eyes. Although wine or other liquids could be poured into the figure’s bowl and out through the bird’s smiling beak, this vessel may have been designed purely as an ingeniously whimsical work of art.",1039.0,"Title

In the early 1930s, Arp began to translate his abstract style into three-dimensional sculptures, emphasizing the natural processes of metamorphosis in art. The artist often realized his sculptures first in plaster, a medium that responded easily to touch and allowed for the element of chance in the creative process, and later in an edition in different media (often bronze). This sculpture is a unique marble enlargement of Arp’s original plaster. The medium—with its hard, bonelike appearance—emphasizes the human, torsolike forms of Growth.",1043.0,"Artist

A 20th-century term, Luminism has consistently been linked to the 19th-century philosophical doctrine of transcendentalism. Stylistically, it is characterized by a horizontal format; tight, invisible brushwork; and pervasive light emanating from an unseen source.

"The Eventuality of Destiny, 1927, Giorgio de Chirico","In the years following World War I, artists across Europe sought to put the disruptions of war behind them. Searching for a new artistic vocabulary, they moved away from the fragmented forms of prewar Cubism and looked to the classical tradition, forging what was known as the “return to order.” This new style had many sources of inspiration, including the art of ancient Greece and Rome, the Renaissance, and even later Neoclassical revivals. Giorgio de Chirico was likewise attracted to the idea of classicism; his The Eventuality of Destiny is in part the result of his study of the works and techniques of the Old Masters.",1046.0,"Artist
