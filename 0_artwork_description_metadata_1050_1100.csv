"New England Scenery, 1839, Thomas Cole","Although Thomas Cole is best known for his scenes of the American wilderness, he also rendered pastoral vistas of cultivated landscapes. This work depicts New Hampshire’s White Mountains, an area that Cole traveled to and painted on numerous occasions, as did other 19th-century landscape artists. The prominent church spire at middle distance emphasizes the role of religion in agrarian society and the glow of the low sun expresses a sense of optimism for a rural America. The painting conveys an ideal that was increasingly far from reality, however, as the United States was then being transformed by rapid urbanization and the Industrial Revolution.",1050.0,"Artist

"Architectural Relief Depicting the Gigantomachy (Battle Between Gods and Giants), 3rd/2nd century BC, Ancient Etruscan","As the name suggests, the Gigantomachy was the struggle between and the Giants and the Olympian gods, who were led by Zeus. In flowing robes, a god and goddess capture a Giant, depicted with wings and serpent-like features, to deliver the final blow in this epic battle. These three animated figures were probably once part of a series of ornamental covers called antefixes, which were placed along the lowest row of roof tiles on a small building, probably a temple.

"Woman and Child at the Well, 1882, Camille Pissarro","By the 1880s, Camille Pissarro, like most of his Impressionist colleagues, sought an alternative to the style he had employed over the previous decade, deciding to focus on figures rather than landscapes. Of the 36 paintings he showed at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in the spring of 1882, 27 were figural. Woman and Child at the Well is one of a series of works depicting peasant girls taking a break from their chores, their poses and gestures suggesting narratives that remain ambiguous. As the model for the boy in this composition, Pissarro used his fourth son, Ludovic-Rodolphe, who was four years old at the time.",1055.0,"Artist

Traditionally, the lily is a symbol of the angel Gabriel, and Mary’s downcast eyes and humble stance imply that she has received his divine message. Hitchcock spent much of his life in Holland, and his work synthesizes elements of several European art movements.

"Untitled, 1948/49, Willem de Kooning","Willem de Kooning established his reputation as a key figure in the Abstract Expressionist movement with a series of black-and-white paintings that he created in the late 1940s using household enamels and paper. Characterized by lyrical brushwork and biomorphic abstractions, these works marked the artist’s shift from a figurative drawing style, largely influenced by Arshile Gorky and other European artists, to the evolving gestural tradition of the New York School. Having eliminated color from his palette at that moment, de Kooning became more spontaneous with his application of paint, pushing his compositions to the edge of the paper. The resulting works embodied the physical act of painting, a defining characteristic of what would later become termed “action painting.”",1065.0,"Artist

Over the course of his long career, he made over 80 self-portraits in oil, in chalk, in pen and ink and wash, and in etching. A large portion of these self-examinations were created while he was a young man, and served to spread his fame, his name and image, while advertising his abilities in portraiture and dramatic expression.

"Self-Portrait Etching at a Window, 1648, Rembrandt van Rijn","When Rembrandt created Self-Portrait at a Window, Drawing on an Etching-Plate, in 1648, it had been nine years since his last major self-portrait etching, the arrogant and famous Self Portrait Leaning on a Sill of 1639, which echoed the Renaissance courtier portraits of Raphael and Titian. The reasons for this significant hiatus have been cause for speculation by various Rembrandt scholars. It had been a time of great turmoil for the artist: his son Titus was born in 1641, but in 1642 his beloved Saskia had died; Nursemaid Geertge Dircx’s insistence on marriage led to lawsuits throughout the decade, resulting in her incarceration. Finally the comforting companionship of Hendrickje Stoffels, introduced to the household about 1648, restored balance to Rembrandt’s life. Christopher White remarked on Rembrandt’s general reluctance to look at himself during the decade of the 1640s.[3] Perry Chapman suggested that Rembrandt’s sudden interest in landscape, about 1640, ""coincided with his suspension of self-portrayal… the solitude of nature served as a alternative form of self-examination.""[4]",1071.0,"Artist

"Self-Portrait Etching at a Window, 1648, Rembrandt van Rijn","Created just a year after the subtle and elegantly individual etched portraits of Jan Six and Ephraim Bonus of 1647, this self-portrait seems more sober and much more introspective. Wearing a plain black hat with high crown and simple studio tunic, the artist seems less gracious and slightly obdurate. Despite appearances, Rembrandt has not yet encountered sobering financial difficulties. It is worth noting that 1639, the year of that aggrandizing earlier self-portrait, was the year in which Rembrandt contracted to purchase his expensive house on the Sint Antonisbreestraat for 13,000 guilders. In 1647, his and Saskia’s marital estate had been estimated at 40,750 guilders, and the precipitous decline of his fortunes would not be apparent for several years. Therefore, Christopher White suggests ""his new introspective mood must have been prompted by personal and artistic reasons, which must have inspired the magic of psychological interpretation. Earlier he had depicted himself from the outside inviting us to be his spectators, but now he studies himself from within, and we feel ourselves intruders in this frank and intimate self-analysis in a mirror, in which one is as near to reading the mind as is humanly possible in a visual medium. The look is piercingly powerful and we see the man himself and not his expression.""[5]",1071.0,"Artist

"Self-Portrait Etching at a Window, 1648, Rembrandt van Rijn","Erik Hinterding noted that the image is built up less with lines than from a range of shades,[6] not unlike the elaborate gradations achieved in the portraits of Six and Bonus, or Rembrandt’s contemporary masterpiece, Christ Preaching, known as The Hundred Guilder Print. Thanks to eight known examples of the unfinished first state,[7] it is possible to study Rembrandt’s working method in creating such a complex medley of intaglio processes. He seems to have used etching to lay in the subject with a dense network of lines, but relied on drypoint to define the forms, and tiny flecks to suggest the face. Indeed, the lines of the visage may not have fully printed until the finished second state, in which in other areas he used a combination of etching, drypoint and engraving so well blended that no single method is easily apparent [8] Rembrandt even used the engraver’s burin to shade his left hand so that the cuff is highlighted, and a fine line of drypoint to outline the right arm and the window.",1071.0,"Artist

Christopher White has said ""in signing it, he must have been aware that he had completed one of the key works of this period of his life… though he made two more self-portraits in etching, this is undoubtedly the greatest and most searching.

For two of the great leaders of the movement, André Breton and Louis Aragon, this engagement defied the core principles of the group by bringing avant-garde art into the marketplace. Others, including Joan Miró, embraced it as a venue for new creative possibilities. In addition to designing theater sets, backdrops, and costumes, Miró was involved in the decorative arts. This painting, titled Painting (Figures with Stars), is one of four cartoons for tapestries commissioned in 1933 by the French art collector and gallery director Marie Cuttoli.

"The Seine at Port-Marly, Piles of Sand, 1875, Alfred Sisley","Of all the landscapes Alfred Sisley painted in and around Marly-le-Roi, where he lived from 1875 to 1878, this scene of workers dredging sand to facilitate barge traffic is perhaps the most original. Generally, the Impressionists showed the Seine River as a place of weekend leisure for Parisians, painting activities such as boating, yachting, promenading, and dining. Sisley depicted the river during the workweek, along with some of the men who depended on it for their livelihood.",1077.0,"Artist

"Number 19, 1949, Mark Rothko","Like many of the New York School painters of the 1940s, Mark Rothko was largely influenced by Surrealism, creating allegorical abstractions depicting biomorphic and mythological forms. By 1947 he abandoned representational imagery entirely and began working with color, light, and space. Number 19 follows the characteristic format of his multiform paintings, in which loosely defined organic shapes hover over a thinly brushed background. Whereas color once assumed a supporting role in his compositions, by this period, color had become a defining force, thus marking the transition from Rothko’s early work to his mature, color-field paintings.",1079.0,"Artist

"Bust of an African Woman, 1851, Charles Henri Joseph Cordier","Charles Henri Joseph Cordier was still a student of French sculptor François Rude when his plaster-cast version of the clay portrait he had modeled of a Sudanese man was accepted to the Paris Salon. Exhibited in the same year that France extended full emancipation to all residents, including those in its African colonies and territories, Cordier’s sculpture was seen as embodying the Romantic ideals of individual liberty. Its detailed realism (including the individual strands of tassels and hair) appealed to the public’s growing interest in ethnographic accuracy, while its strong features and dignified expression matched the European tradition for expressing moral and physical purity. Two years later, Cordier created a female portrait that was equally acclaimed as a blend of realism (the model wears a patterned wrap, heavy earrings, and coral necklace, all associated with East Africa) and idealism (in the sitter’s regal and aristocratic bearing). In 1851 casts of both sculptures were commissioned for the anthropological gallery of the National History Museum in Paris, and for the International Exhibition in London, sealing their fate as companion pendants. While Cordier came to specialize in ethnographic sculpture and made several trips to North Africa during his lifetime, it is by these two works that he is best remembered.",1080.0,"Artist

"Untitled, c. 1938–41, Jackson Pollock","The late 1930s marked a key period of transition for Jackson Pollock, in which he began to separate himself from the influence of his early mentor, the regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton. Pollock became engaged in an intense dialogue with the work of the Mexican muralists José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros; he was inspired by their social commitment and use of primitive, archetypal imagery. The expressionistic style and oblong format of Untitled recall Orozco’s murals at Pomona and Dartmouth Colleges, which Pollock had seen firsthand. The bullfight imagery evokes the work of Pablo Picasso, whose Guernica (1937) made a powerful impression on Pollock when he saw the painting in New York in 1939.",1081.0,"Artist

"Mastoid (Drinking Cup) with Handles, about 500/480 BC, Ancient Greek","This handled cup was likely used as part of the Greek symposium. Much like modern academic symposiums, in which people discuss a topic of common interest, debunking old theories and putting forth new hypotheses; the men of ancient Athens regularly got together in private homes to exchange ideas. Afterward the participants might continue the conversation, discussing their impressions in greater detail or simply socializing over a drink. As the evening progressed, participants engaged in other pleasures, including games, performances, and sex.",1083.0,"Culture

"Mastoid (Drinking Cup) with Handles, about 500/480 BC, Ancient Greek","Wine played a major role in fueling these evenings, and as such the myriad vessels used in the symposium often paid homage to drink. Here Dionysos, the god of wine and theater, is shown riding a donkey who’s exaggerated physical arousal would have appealed to the ancient Greeks’ often bawdy sense of humor. The god is accompanied by his female companions, known as maenads, who were notorious for the kind of ecstatic, freewheeling dances they perform here.",1083.0,"Culture

"Boats at Rest, c. 1895, Arthur Wesley Dow","In 1891 Arthur Wesley Dow began to engage seriously with the formal elements of Japanese art in his prints and oil paintings. In works such as Boats at Rest, he depicted locales around his native Ipswich, Massachusetts, using the radical cropping, elevated perspective, and flattened pictorial space characteristic of ukiyo-e (Japanese woodblock) prints. His palette of bold colors, however, is more akin to the work of French Post-Impressionist artists such as Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin. Dow’s Japanese-inspired theories of composition, which he outlined both in his publications and in the classes he taught at the Ipswich Summer School of Art and the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, were immensely influential to artists and designers working in both two and three dimensions.",1087.0,"Artist

"Brilliant Yellow #9, 1964/65, Jo Baer","In the 1960s, Jo Baer emerged as a central figure in the community of artists that included Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, and Sol LeWitt. Although Baer’s work from this period relied on the simple geometric forms and serial imagery of much Minimal and Conceptual art of the time, her practice was distinguished by her unwavering commitment to the medium of paint on canvas. Baer was primarily interested in using painting as a vehicle for exploring the complexities of visual perception. From 1963 to 1975, she limited her ""imagery"" to bands of black combined with colors at the edges of the canvas as a means of emphasizing the essential, objectlike qualities of painting.",1092.0,"Artist

"The Solitude of the Soul, modeled in plaster 1901; sculpted in marble 1914, Lorado Taft","The Neoclassicism of the sculptors Harriet Hosmer and Randolph Rogers was replaced in the second half of the 19th century by the more realistic naturalism of French-trained sculptors such as Lorado Taft. An instructor in modeling at the School of the Art Institute for 20 years, Taft created public monuments for Chicago that made the city a center for sculpture. The figures in this work are only partly freed from the marble, a technique that emphasizes the mass and outline of the stone. Explaining The Solitude of the Soul, Taft wrote, “The thought is the eternally present fact that however closely we may be thrown together by circumstances … we are unknown to each other.”",1093.0,"Artist

"Twilight, c. 1926, Hale Woodruff","Twilight, one of Hale Woodruff’s early paintings, is a vivid landscape that reflects his desire to define himself as a modernist. A scene of a small grove of trees backlit by an intense sunset, the painting exuberantly evokes the brilliant color of the Fauves (French for “wild beasts”). The artist applied bold streaks of pigment using fluid brushstrokes, drawing attention to the paint’s texture. Paintings such as Twilight inspired the acclaimed Harlem Renaissance author Alain Locke to praise the young artist: “Mr. Woodruff paints landscapes of originality,” with a “warm beauty” of color. Woodruff later became a highly influential muralist and educator, dedicated to promoting the works and careers of African American artists.",1096.0,"Artist
