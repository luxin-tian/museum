"Reliquary Monstrance with a Tooth of Saint John the Baptist, 1433; container: 900/1200, Weddeghe Velstede","This reliquary uses the form of a miniature Gothic tower. It makes an elaborate architectural frame for a transparent rock-crystal vessel holding a relic that is identified as a tooth of Saint John the Baptist by an inscription along the base of the reliquary. Rock crystal was highly prized in the medieval Islamic world. Considered a precious stone, it was used to create a number of luxurious secular objects, including this vessel, which was probably originally intended to be a container for fragrant oils.",1107.0,"Artist

"The Crucifixion, 1538, Lucas Cranach, the Elder","In this crowded scene, traditional vignettes from the Crucifixion story surround the central figure of Christ on the cross. The swooning Virgins and other believers are represented at Christ’s right hand. On the other, less-favored side of the cross are Christ’s condemners and the cynics who rejected him, among them the soldiers who cast dice to divide up his clothing. Although Lucas Cranach the Elder was a friend of Martin Luther and a firm supporter of the Reformation, his highly successful workshop produced altarpieces for both Protestant and Catholic patrons. In this painting, probably used as an altarpiece, the artist does not take a stand in the doctrinal struggle that grew out of Luther’s preaching and writing beginning in 1517.",1108.0,"Artist

"The River, 1942, O. Louis Guglielmi","In The River, Louis Guglielmi depicted female figures alongside an expanse of blue water. Hemmed in by the monolithic concrete riverbank, with an industrial landscape in the distance, the natural flow of water seems controlled and possibly reshaped. The expressions of the three women standing in the foreground are concealed from the viewer, contributing to the sense of ambiguity created by the vivid contrast between the natural and man-made landscapes. Commenting on The River, one critic noted that Guglielmi “interprets the relationship of man to his city environment. Often more profound than social consciousness, his work somehow suggests the theme of man oppressed by his own great triumphs.”",1111.0,"Artist

"Eve after the Fall, Modeled 1883, carved about 1886, Auguste Rodin","Auguste Rodin’s sculpture Eve owes its genesis to The Gates of Hell, the artist’s major commission from the French government in 1880. The associations posed by the sculptural portals of that project led Rodin back to the art of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Michelangelo, particularly their depiction of biblical stories from the book of Genesis. A number of elements from the Gates—such as The Thinker, Adam, and Eve—gradually evolved into independent works. In particular, Eve recalls the most sculptural of Renaissance paintings: Michelangelo’s panels from the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and Masaccio’s Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Its naturalism shocked critics when it was first exhibited, since Eve seemed to them more like a flesh-and-blood woman than an idealized creation.",1120.0,"Artist

"The Music Lesson, c. 1670, Géraerd Ter Borch","Gerard Terborch specialized in small-scale portraits and scenes of everyday life, now known as genre scenes. His interiors provide an evocative setting for figures absorbed in the rituals of everyday life, with distracting domestic furniture kept to a minimum. His mature genre paintings deal with “high-life” subjects: officers and elegant young women conversing, making music, or exchanging letters. Here a lady plays an elaborate stringed instrument, the double-headed lute, while her companion marks the tempo for her. He is presumably her music master, but, as is typical for Terborch, the precise relationship of the figures remains tantalizingly ambiguous.",1123.0,"Artist

"Life Study (Study of an Egyptian Girl), 1891, John Singer Sargent","John Singer Sargent was an internationally renowned portrait painter who also executed several mural commissions, including a series on the history of religion for the Boston Public Library (1890–1919). He traveled to Egypt in 1891 in search of source material and inspiration, drawn to the Middle East, like many of his contemporaries, by the region’s perceived exoticism and its ancient histories. Sargent painted this full-length figure study of an anonymous woman in a studio in Cairo. Instead of using the bravura painterly style of swift, visible brushstrokes that characterizes his society portraits, Sargent returned to his academic training, carefully modeling the woman’s form and flesh tones. She assumes a complicated pose, placing her weight on her right foot while twisting her upper body to the left. Life Study was widely exhibited, including at the Salon du Champs de Mars in Paris in 1892 and the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.",1124.0,"Artist

"Polychrome Jar with Rainbow, Macaw, and Floral Motifs, 1880s, Acoma","In the American Southwest, there is an Indian ceramic tradition that began to take form in the early centuries A.D. and has continued unbroken to the present time. Characterized by its many superbly varied styles, the art has been sustained by diverse Pueblo peoples and some of their neighbors, whose ancient and more recent settlements have long been established in the arid regions of Arizona and New Mexico. Ceramic artist of the Ácoma Pueblo, west of Albuquerque, produced an especially distinguished series of vessels during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
This large, rounded, and beautifully proportioned vessel is covered by exuberant, colorful figures representing macaws and other birds, double rainbows, flowers, and plants. The fluid, lively pattern breaks from the disciplined, abstract symmetry that widely prevails in Puebloan tradition, possibly reflecting the influence of designs from Mexico or perhaps the printed or embroidered textiles from the eastern United States that reached New Mexico beginning in the mid-nineteenth century. Nevertheless, traditional indigenous perceptions remained in play, for macaws have been featured for centuries in Puebloan rituals devoted to the sun, rain, and agricultural fertility, as shown in corresponding ceramic and mural imagery. In this context the rainbows, flowers, and the sense of thriving life also faithfully adhere to an ancient and ongoing theme of communal participation in nature’s eternal renewal.

"Head of a Woman, summer 1909, Pablo Picasso","This painting dates to one of the most productive and inventive periods of Pablo Picasso’s career, a summer stay in the town of Horta de Ebro (now Horta de San Juan) in Spain, which lasted, with minor interruptions, from May to September of 1909. During these months, Picasso produced a series of landscapes, heads, and still lifes that are among the most highly acclaimed achievements of early Cubism. Fernande Olivier, Picasso’s mistress, was the model for the series of heads that the artist produced at this time.
In this painting, the contrast between the naturalistic still life in the background and the boldly faceted figure in the foreground illustrates an important stage in Picasso’s evolution at the time. A series of still lifes by Picasso that were inspired by the art of Paul Cezanne preceded Picasso’s powerful probing into the nature of solid form, which is exemplified here by the treatment of the head. By vigorously modeling the form in a manner that blatantly disregards the rules of illusionistic painting, Picasso conveyed information about the subject’s underlying structure, about its development in the round (Olivier’s bun, for example, which would normally not be visible from the front, is brought into full view), and a remarkably tactile sense of its projections and recessions. Not surprisingly, these highly sculptural portraits led Picasso to turn, as he did intermittently throughout his career, to actual sculpture upon his return to Paris in the autumn of 1909. The result was the head of Fernande Olivier, an early bronze cast of which is in the Art Institute. In this sculpture, Picasso combined the faceting of the face seen in our painting with the scalloped treatment of the hair found in a drawing from this same period, which is also in the collection of the Art Institute. The artist then energized the head through a dynamic torsion of the neck, replacing the relaxed, fleshy folds in the painting with an emphasis on the taut curve of the back of the neck, as the head bends and twists in space. Although Cubism was to exert an enormous influence on the move toward abstraction among many artists in the early part of this century, Fernande Olivier reminds us that Cubism itself was firmly rooted in an intense study of material reality.
This painting was once in the famed collection of expatriates Leo and Gertrude Stein in Paris, and can in fact be seen hanging on the wall of Gertrude Stein’s study in a photograph of 1914/15.",1134.0,"Artist

"Rinaldo and the Magus of Ascalon, 1742/45, Giambattista Tiepolo","The fourth and final large narrative canvas from Giovanni Battista Tiepolo’s decorative suite takes place as Rinaldo rejoins the crusader army. As a consequence, it stresses the moral element of the story of Rinaldo and Armida. The boat bringing the knight from Armida’s island seems to have just deposited him and his companions, Carlo and Ubaldo, on the coast of Palestine. Here the magician of Ascalon uses Rinaldo’s shield to conjure up the heroic deeds of his ancestors, urging him to live up to their examples. Rinaldo appears more confident and mature than he does in the earlier canvases in the sequence, perhaps to serve as an example to the young member of the Cornaro family for whom the salon was splendidly redecorated.",1135.0,"Artist

His work responded to developments in the painting of Andrea Mantegna, Albrecht Dürer, Giorgione, and Titian. In emulation of their atmospheric colorism, Giulio developed a method of engraving with flicks or dots, which produces subtle gradations of tone. Thus, he is credited with inventing the ""dotted manner"" print, which is exemplified in this impression of the Roman goddess of love and beauty.",1137.0,"Artist

"Renganeschi’s Saturday Night, 1912, John Sloan","John Sloan often explored the leisure activities of working-class women and the changing social mores of the 20th century. Here he focused on three women who sit together at the central table of a popular Italian restaurant in New York City. By showing the women celebrating a night out on the town, the artist emphasized their newfound freedom to socialize in public spaces without the need for male escorts. Although he indicated their working-class status through their “unladylike” gestures—legs wrapped around their chairs and pinkies flared in the air—Sloan did not cast judgment on the women’s relaxed behavior. His informal style and loose brushwork enliven this scene of urban leisure with a sense of immediacy and action.",1140.0,"Artist
