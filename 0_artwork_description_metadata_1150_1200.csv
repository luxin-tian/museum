"The Fates Gathering in the Stars, 1887, Elihu Vedder","Elihu Vedder adapted this painting from an illustration he designed for an 1884 edition of Edward FitzGerald’s translation of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. An expatriate artist who lived in Rome for most of his life, Vedder was attracted to mysterious, visionary subject matter. The artist used the Rubaiyat to express his own philosophical beliefs regarding such metaphysical and spiritual questions as death and the existence of an afterlife, subjects that are at the core of Khayyam’s poetry. This image depicts the three Fates of Greek mythology—Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos—working the thread of life. Clotho spins the thread, Lachesis fixes its length, and Atropos cuts it at the appointed time of death. The Fates are symbolized by the spindle, distaff, and shears in the foreground and represent the poet’s belief that mankind has no control over destiny.",1153.0,"Artist

"The Return of Odysseus (Homage to Pinturicchio and Benin), 1977, Romare Howard Bearden","This collage is one of series completed in 1977 depicting scenes from Homer’s epic poem The Odyssey. Romare Bearden’s composition mimics the Italian painter Bernardino Pintoricchio’s early-16th-century painting of Odysseus returning home after the Trojan War. However, Bearden’s reinterpretation moves the scene to the West African country of Benin. By changing the ethnicity of the characters, Bearden made the story more accessible to minority audiences. He said of the series, “It is universal. So if a child in Benin or in Louisiana … sees my paintings of Odysseus, he can understand the myth better.”",1155.0,"Artist

"A Vision, 1925/26, Joseph Stella","In 1922 Joseph Stella revisited his native Italy and became fascinated by Renaissance painting. After returning to New York, he began to produce detailed, symbolic compositions such as A Vision, which was originally a mural commission. Stella was enthralled by the tropical plants he observed at the Bronx Botanical Garden, and here he imagined a woman growing out of the earth like the exotic flowers on either side of her.

"The Music Lesson, 1671, Jacob Ochtervelt","One of Jacob Ochtervelt’s finest works, The Music Lesson was probably painted in Rotterdam, where the artist spent most of his career. The delicate light, which illuminates the girl and leaves the youth partly in shadow, is indebted to Johannes Vermeer, who worked in the nearby city of Delft. Characteristic of Ochtervelt, however, are the angled poses and the playful interchange between the figures. The girl holds a violin, an instrument more often played by men, and points authoritatively to the music score in an ironic reversal of the roles of the sexes.",1157.0,"Artist

"Blood Pool, 1992, Kiki Smith","In sculptures such as Blood Pool, Kiki Smith created uncomfortable, life-size figures that challenge and extend the tradition of human representation by treating the body as the site of biological, genetic, social, and political battles. Composed of wax, which Smith favors for its malleability, Blood Pool evokes the texture and color of flesh. Although the point of departure for her pieces is literal—she always works from casts of live models—the figure, with its fetal pose and exposed spine, becomes a primal emblem that engages viewers in issues of individual and collective health and disease, heroization and victimization, and life and death (particularly because of the dual potential of human blood in the era of AIDS).",1158.0,"Artist

In 1879 France experienced an extraordinarily severe winter, which Pissarro explored in this and other works painted at his home in Pontoise, 30 miles west of Paris, along the Seine River. In Rabbit Warren, snow covers the ground, houses, and vegetation in a frothy coat that resulted from the artist’s vigorous brushwork.

"After Egon Schiele, 1982, Sherrie Levine","For over forty years, Sherrie Levine has addressed issues of authorship and originality. Appropriating images from art history—often citations of works by male artists—Levine considers the relationships between authenticity and subjectivity and desire and power. For After Egon Schiele, the artist photographed reproductions of eighteen self-portraits by the early 20th-century Austrian painter Egon Schiele.
She did not alter the original images but recontextualized them through the act of appropriation. The finished
work is at once a copy and an original, authored anew by Levine. Commenting on the choice for these particular selfportraits by Schiele, she explained, “There is something in his eroticism that strikes a chord. Partly it’s the selfconscious representation of his own narcissism.”",1168.0,"Artist

He did not adhere to one particular artistic style, though he admired earlier artists like Rembrandt and Jean-Siméon Chardin and the more recent Fauves and Expressionists. In the mid-1920s, Soutine produced a group of still-life paintings primarily featuring hanging game and meat carcasses, subjects found in European art for centuries. Rather than depicting the dead animals as lifeless and limp, however, he often portrayed them as tragic figures; in works like Dead Fowl, the visceral quality of the thick, swirling paint suggests the bird’s writhing battle against death.",1175.0,"Artist

"The Gulf Stream, probably 1899, dated by the artist “1889”, Winslow Homer","Homer’s exploration of life and death in the tropics found ultimate expression in his oil painting The Gulf Stream painted at Prout’s Neck following his return from the Bahamas. A group of four watercolors documents the evolution of this terrifying seascape, which details the plight of a solitary black man, adrift in stormy seas on a broken boat and encircled by a school of aggressive requiem sharks. In early 1885, on his first trip to the Bahamas, Homer had painted Shark Fishing which depicts two fishermen controlling a hooked shark that struggles, mouth open, in the immediate foreground. On this same trip, the artist executed a similar subject, Sharks (The Derelict). In this work, an unmanned wooden boat, broken-masted and taking on water, is under attack by at least three large, circling animals. The fact that the boat is empty leaves the viewer to wonder if the worst has already happened.
Homer’s 1898 voyage to the Bahamas must have reminded him of these works, suggesting the idea for his next major painting. Either in Nassau, or more likely after he returned to Prout’s Neck, he developed the theme in two watercolors. One is Study for “The Gulf Stream”, a detailed view of the bow of the derelict boat that corresponds closely to the final painting. In the work, the artist trimmed a horizontal sheet into a vertical format and filled it nearly to the top with churning waves. In the Art Institute’s watercolor study The Gulf Stream, Homer positioned the shark so that it appears to swim over the submerged side of the boat. It is probable that he painted this work in his Prout’s Neck studio, where he would have been able to refer to the studies from 1885. He trimmed the bottom of The Gulf Stream sheet, forcing the belly of the shark right up against the picture plane. In both this watercolor and in the finished painting, the impassive (or dazed) expression of the castaway and his surprisingly relaxed (or resigned) pose imbue the subject with ambiguity.",1180.0,"Artist

Although Katz’s insistence on figuration initially placed him outside the contemporary avant-garde mainstream, in which abstraction dominated, his inventive resolution of the demands of formalism and representation responded to the Pop Art movement of the 1960s and eventually established him as a leader of the new figurative tradition in painting. Often featuring his wife, family, and friends as portrait subjects, his works emphasize the flatness of the picture plane while remaining determinedly realistic, resulting in highly stylized images that appear at once specific and generic. This painting shows Katz’s son, Vincent, with his boyhood friend Tony.",1185.0,"Artist

The church, the carefully tended fields, and the hayrick on the right are all finely delineated in a manner typical of Inness’s early style. Although the artist’s reverent handling of color and light in this image has often been linked to his interest in Swedenborgian spirituality, it also relates to his admiration for this particular expanse of the American landscape. During the mid-19th century, the Catskill Mountain range was America’s premiere tourist site. The region’s close proximity to urban centers and abundant spectacular views made the Catskills a popular destination for those who wanted to escape from the bustle of modern life.",1187.0,"Artist

The Cloisters depicts a small, empty room at the Ephrata Cloister, located near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, about 50 miles from Wyeth’s home in Chadds Ford. It was the seat of the German Seventh-day Baptists, an early American religious colony that had disbanded in 1934 and was being restored as a historic landmark when Wyeth visited with his aunt Elizabeth in 1949. Wyeth’s early studies portrayed Elizabeth in the room, but he eliminated her figure and increasingly abstracted the space to focus on the play of light against the muted brown walls. The bird, a chalk sculpture of the type produced by residents of the Ephrata Cloister, stands as a slightly surreal evocation of the history of the colony and Elizabeth’s one-time presence in the scene.",1188.0,"Artist
