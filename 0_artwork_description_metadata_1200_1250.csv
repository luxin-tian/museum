"Self-Portrait, c. 1920, Archibald John Motley Jr.","Chicagoan Archibald Motley attended the School of the Art Institute at a time when many prominent art academies denied entrance to African American students. His affiliation with the school was thus of great significance to him. Around 1920, as a recent graduate, he painted a self-portrait meant to introduce him as a poised young artist, elegantly presenting himself in a dark suit jacket, crisp white shirt, and a dark tie accented by a diamond horseshoe pin. Furthermore, Motley painted this work following race riots in July 1919, which had heightened tensions in Chicago. The violence convinced him that he should use his art to influence perceptions of African Americans in a positive manner. This sophisticated self-portrait is thus an extraordinary declaration of his goals and ambitions.",1201.0,"Artist

"Nydia, The Blind Flower Girl of Pompeii, modeled 1855–56, carved 1858, Randolph Rogers","This statue is based on a character from Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s popular 1834 novel The Last Days of Pompeii. In the episode depicted here, Nydia and her two companions attempt to flee the city after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The three become separated, however, and Randolph Rogers captured Nydia as she gropes her way through the burning city. The broken Corinthian column at her feet symbolizes fallen Pompeii, and Nydia’s clinging garments, entangled in her staff, indicate her chaotic surroundings. Because of its narrative quality, sentimental presentation, and classical features and proportions, this sculpture was extremely popular with the American public upon its first being exhibited.",1202.0,"Artist

"Family of Robot: Baby, 1986, Nam June Paik","A pioneering figure in electronic art, Nam June Paik was among the first to use television as an art form. Originally a composer of experimental and electronic music, he created performance work within the context of the Fluxus movement in the 1950s. The artist viewed his musical instruments as “objects with visual qualities,” which allowed him to move fluidly from using sound to incorporating images into his creations. Having begun exhibiting works with televisions in 1963, Paik was one of the earliest artists to use a Sony Portapak (the first portable video recording device) after it became available in 1965, producing his initial multimonitor video sculptures the following year.
Family of Robot, the first series of video sculptures that Paik created, consists of three generations of family members, including a grandmother and grandfather; mother and father; aunt and uncle; and children. Paik pursued the theme of generational difference through his choice of materials, providing a unified history of family and technology. Viewed as a whole, this group of anthropomorphic sculptures incorporates media hardware from various stages of its evolution in the twentieth century. The grandparents’ heads are constructed of 1930s radios and their bodies of 1940s television frames refitted with Sony or Quasar screens, while the parents’ heads are more recent than their bodies. The children, including Baby, are made of newer televisions. In some cases, the children’s heads are two decades more advanced than their bodies, and in others, both sections are made of uniform parts. The Art Institute’s Baby—one of nine unique baby robots—was assembled from thirteen Samsung monitors, which at the time were the most up-to-date equipment manufactured in Korea. The monitors are placed in different directions in the aluminum armature, depending on the section of the body they represent.
In Family of Robot, television is used not as a means of disseminating information but rather as a more decorative element. Like its relatives, Baby displays an artist-created videotape—in this case, one that consists of flashing, vibrant images of hearts, psychedelic patterns, revolving bands and planets, and excerpts of newscasts depicting people, especially children, in Africa and India. Paik insisted that a balance should exist between nature and technology, a notion that he realized in this friendly looking figure, which is a remarkable product of his own time and effort.
With this series, Paik suggested that technology is both a product of human innovation and a potential cause of our retreat from reality. In a sense, he explicitly humanized technology as a means of resistance, commenting, “One must … know technology very well in order to be able to overcome it.” Stating that the purpose of video art is “to liberate people from the tyranny of TV,” he was perhaps reminding us of the capability of technology—or, more specifically, of broadcast television—to consume our lives, and asserting the need for us to see it in a different form, such as art. Although Baby’s televisions are now dated themselves, this obsolescence only enhances the work’s ability to evoke the rapid transformation of technology.",1206.0,"Artist

"This, My Brother, 1942, Charles White","Like many artists of his generation, Chicagoan Charles White believed that art could be an influential force in the struggle to promote racial equality for African Americans, stating, “Paint is the only weapon I have with which to fight what I resent.” He addressed the quest for dignity and freedom in This, My Brother, which takes its title from a poem by John Rood about a rural miner who experiences a political awakening.

"Mount Equinox, Winter, 1921, Rockwell Kent","An artist with an adventurous spirit, Rockwell Kent traveled widely, gravitating to such harsh and snowy locales as Alaska, Greenland, Newfoundland, and New England for his painted landscapes. Kent set up a small shack to use as a studio in remote Vermont, which he described as a “handy refuge for a frozen realist.” It was there that he captured this view of Mount Equinox in winter, one of a group of paintings that he executed of the peak at different seasons. Although grounded in realism, Kent’s landscapes are not straightforward transcriptions of the natural world; rather, they are harmonious compositions featuring simplified forms, vivid colors, sharp contrasts, and astute design.",1210.0,"Artist

"Side Panel of a Sarcophagus, First half of the 3rd century AD, Ancient Roman","This panel was once the side wall of a massive stone coffin. It is decorated in relief with a scene taken from the life of the Greek mythical hero Meleager, who led the hunt for a wild boar that was terrorizing the people of Calydon. Here the valiant hunter stands in the center, his right foot resting on a rock. He is surrounded by his companions, including Herakles at the far left, who is armed with his distinctive knobby club, and his beloved, Atalanta (now headless), seated on the right. Meleager’s head resembles portraits of Alexander the Great (356–323 B.C.), the Macedonian king and general who conquered Asia as far east as the Indus River, perhaps because the Romans equated success in the hunt with victory on the battlefield. It is possible that the owner of this sarcophagus wished to equate his bravery and achievements with those of both Meleager and Alexander.",1212.0,"Culture

"By-Products Plants, 1923/26, Joseph Stella","While studying art in Italy and France from 1909 to 1913, Joseph Stella was captivated by Italian Futurism, a movement that employed Cubism’s fragmented forms to express the mechanization and speed of modern life. After he returned to the United States, Stella used Futurism to convey the dynamism of American industry in paintings such as By-Products Plants, which depicts the factories that extract ammonia, tar, and light oils when coal is burned. Such mechanical processes fascinated Stella, and he later recalled, “opposite my studio was a huge factory … towering with the gloom of a prison. At night fires gave to innumerable windows menacing blazing looks of demons.” Stella invested his factory paintings with this sense of eerie mystery.",1215.0,"Artist

His portraits are noted for their penetrating insight into character. The subject of this painting, the emotionally unstable Alessandro de’ Medici, was probably an illegitimate son of Pope Clement VII by a Moorish slave. Alessandro was named the first Duke of Florence in 1532, after the defeat of the city’s republican government by an alliance of the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Alessandro’s tyrannical reign ended in 1537, when he was assassinated by his cousin. This appears to be a preliminary painting of the duke that Pontormo consulted in the creation of a larger format state portrait now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.",1216.0,"Artist

"Court House Studies, Interior Perspective Study, c. 1931–1938, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe","Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in the development of modern architecture. Operating on a principle of “less is more,” he utilized materials such as industrial steel and plate glass in his strikingly minimal designs, which are notably free of decorative forms. As director of the German Bauhaus during the early 1930s, Mies formalized his notion of unifying form with function. In 1937 he immigrated to Chicago, where he became director of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute of Technology (later the Illinois Institute of Technology). His legacy is still felt in the school’s program of stressing the fundamentals, materials, and function of architectural design. This Court House Study depicts a vast, open interior in which two slender columns provide the only visible means of support. The wide-angle perspective emphasizes the building’s strong horizontal character. A nearly seamless wall of glass fills living areas with light and dissolves the boundary between interior and exterior.",1222.0,"Artist

"Swing Music (Louis Armstrong), 1938, Arthur Dove","Like many modernists, Arthur Dove sought to suggest a connection between his paintings and music, which he admired for its ability to suggest absolute feeling, free of reference to the material world. An ardent amateur musician, he depicted musical subjects throughout his career. In the late 1920s he began listening to music while painting and simultaneously initiated a series of works on forms of popular music such as jazz and swing. Swing Music (Louis Armstrong) celebrates the renowned jazz trumpeter, who, in the 1930s, led swing-style orchestras. For Dove this topic was especially attractive because it evoked the dynamism characteristic of 20th-century life. Its specifically American nature made it an ideal subject for the native modernism that Dove and the other artists from the circle of Alfred Stieglitz sought to establish. Stieglitz exhibited this painting at his gallery An American Place.",1239.0,"Artist

Morris Kantor, a Russian-born immigrant, was inspired by the colonial houses he encountered during summers in New England. Here he painted the living room of an early American house, yet his rendering takes on a suggestion of Surrealism through his inclusion of ominous black shadows—in the shape of a ghostly figure at the right—that encroach upon the room. Kantor depicted the surrounding houses in the inky depths of these forms, bringing the dark night into the brightly lit room.

"1951-52, 1951/52, Clyfford Still","In the late 1940s, Clyfford Still, along with Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko, originated the type of Abstract Expressionism known as Field Painting, a term used to describe large canvases dominated by one uniform color or a few colors closely related in hue and value. In contrast to Newman and Rothko, who usually applied paint thinly and uniformly, Still used a palette knife, creating textural effects that give the surface a complex, nearly sculptural sense of materiality. Named after the years of its creation, 1951–52 is a rare, nearly all-black work in the artist’s oeuvre. A vertical white line to the right of center and a thin streak of red-orange along the left side provide the sole interruptions in the black field.
