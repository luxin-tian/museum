"Woman in front of a Still Life by Cézanne, 1890, Paul Gauguin","In this work, an unidentified woman sits in front of Paul Cézanne’s 1879–80 Still Life with Fruit Dish, now at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The painting was part of Paul Gauguin’s own collection, and here he proprietarily signed his name over its white frame. Of the five or six Cézannes that he acquired while still a banker, this was the one he claimed he would never part with, “except in a case of direst necessity.” (He would eventually sell it to pay for medical treatment in Tahiti.) Although the version in this painting is nearly to scale with the original, it is more a translation than a copy, with rhythmical arabesques that are characteristic of Gauguin’s painting style rather than Cézanne’s.",1307.0,"Artist

"Painting, 1952, Franz Kline","Until the early 1940s, Franz Kline painted realistic landscapes, portraits, and cityscapes that were inspired by the textures and forms of New York City. Around 1949 he began to make black-and-white canvases such as Painting, which, while abstract, continue to suggest the invigorating energy of urban street life. The artist’s preparation for his paintings included making numerous sketches on newspaper or telephone-book pages. He then translated a small-scale drawing onto canvas, as, what he called, “strokes expanding as entities in themselves.” Utilizing housepainters’ brushes, Kline tacked his canvases to a wood panel in order to obtain the hard surface that he needed to paint his world of eternally colliding forces. Though the many visible drip marks imply a quick, spontaneous execution, the artist returned to this work several times over a two-month period to refine and strengthen its rhythm and spacing.",1309.0,"Artist

"De la nada vida a la nada muerte, 1965, Frank Stella","Known for his early stripe paintings and elaborately shaped canvases, the prodigiously inventive Frank Stella always works in series. De la nada vida a la nada muerte is the largest of his Running V paintings—a set of large, monochromatic striped pictures whose titles derive from colloquial Spanish expressions. The length and mellifluous sound of this work’s title, which literally means “From life nothing to death nothing,” coincides with the rising and falling visual cadences of the painting. The two-dimensional surface, which appears as if it might continue into infinity, consists of 20 parallel lines and seems to alternately project from and recede into the wall. Although Stella’s rigorously calibrated surface, immaculate execution, and use of monochromatic gold pigment temper this painting, they barely constrain its kinetic exuberance.",1314.0,"Artist

"Ritual Impersonator of the Deity Xipe Totec, 1450/1500, Aztec (Mexica)","As a god of the late dry season and early rainy season (May–June), Xipe Totec (“The Flayed One”) expresses regeneration. By the time of Spanish contact in 1519, the cult of this deity was widespread throughout Mesoamerica. This figure depicts a young male wearing the skin of a sacrificed victim, a primary symbolic aspect of rituals conducted during agricultural fertility ceremonies dedicated to this deity. The lines across the chest represent stitched seams where the skin was fastened. Like living seed within a dried husk, the deity impersonator embodies the relationship between death and the renewal of life.",1315.0,"Culture

"Madam Pompadour, 1915, Amedeo Modigliani","Born of Jewish parents in the Italian coastal town of Leghorn, Amedeo Modigliani settled in Paris in 1906, where he developed friendships with Pablo Picasso , the poet Max Jacob, the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, and other members of the literary and artistic avant-garde, many of whom appear in his portraits. He led a notoriously bohemian life, shortened by a self-destructive use of alcohol and drugs. Modigliani produced his finest paintings between 1914 and his premature death in 1920. Within a limited range of subjects, mainly portraits and nudes, he developed a highly distinctive style of sensitively elongated forms.
In this portrait, Modigliani’s emphasis is on a strong formal structure dominated by the grid in the background and the echoing curves of the sitter’s hat, shoulders, and features. There is none of the pathos often associated with his work. The artist seems instead to have invested this portrait with a note of ironic detachment, even humor, reflected in both the title of the painting (which refers to Madame de Pompadour, mistress of King Louis XV of France) and the expression of amused inscrutability worn by the sitter. Were painter and sitter perhaps both amused by the flamboyant hat? Modigliani’s skill in rhyming forms, while at the same time keeping us visually interested and slightly off-balance, is evident throughout the picture, which resonates with the lessons of Paul Cezanne, Cubism, and African sculpture.
The sitter for this portrait may well have been Beatrice Hastings, an English poetess who was Modigliani’s mistress at the time. Because of the artist’s tendency to generalize his sitter’s features, however, a comparison of this portrait with others of Hastings is inconclusive.

The State Street Bridge, with its characteristic curving ironwork, draws the viewer’s eye into the picture. Clark’s scene is in the tradition of
the urban realism of the French Impressionists, recalling such pictures as Claude Monet’s Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare (1877; the Art Institute of Chicago).

"Christ Washing the Feet of His Disciples, 1720/30, Nicolas Bertin","Nicolas Bertin was primarily a painter of religious, mythological, and allegorical subjects. Although trained in the rigorous French academic traditions, he often emulated the broader style of Titian, Paolo Veronese, and other Venetian Renaissance masters. For his depiction of Christ washing Saint Peter’s feet just after the Last Supper (John 13:4-5), Bertin created a majestic, theatrical backdrop reminiscent of those in Veronese’s pictures. Through gesture and facial expression Bertin adeptly described a range of emotions, from surprise and puzzlement to humility.",1323.0,"Artist

"Rip Van Winkle, 1829, John Quidor","One of the most original literary painters of the mid-19th century, John Quidor frequently drew on the popular tales of the American author Washington Irving, interpreting them with great imagination and a genuine flair for drama. Quidor’s Rip Van Winkle depicts the moment that Rip, awake after his 20-year sleep in the Catskill Mountains, confronts the suspicious townsfolk who do not recognize their long-lost neighbor. Unlike many portrayals of Rip Van Winkle that emphasize his age and confusion, Quidor’s version casts Rip as strong and defiant. Gesturing forcefully at his son (who is slumped against a tree), Rip acts to regain his sense of belonging in a now-unfamiliar world.",1328.0,"Artist

It was displayed between the choir and the nave, which was the space reserved for the congregation. Originally painted and gilded, it would have provided a dramatic focal point for the faithful. Christ’s figure, with drooping head, closed eyes, and limp body, emphasizes his humanity and suffering.

"Table with Pink Tablecloth, 1964, Richard Artschwager","Richard Artschwager’s work defies categorization, yet it often combines elements of both Pop Art and Minimalism. An early example of his “furniture surrogates,” which draw upon his experience as the owner of a successful carpentry and furniture-design business, Table with Pink Tablecloth was exhibited— along with other compact, geometric masses wrapped with formica “pictures” so that they resemble domestic items—in his first solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery, New York, in 1965. Artschwager described this work as “the way a table with a tablecloth is in a painting, in a still life—a three-dimensional still life.” Too short to be useful as a piece of furniture, this translation of a Parsons table depicts a solid form as both mass and void and attempts to reveal the levels of deception involved in pictorial illusionism.",1340.0,"Artist

He modeled Woman (Elevation) after Isabel Dutaud Nagle, whom he married in 1917, telling her, “I want to create a miracle with it… as great as you.” Although it definitely evokes his subject’s appearance, this sculpture represents Lachaise’s first full-scale expression of the idealized female form that would come to dominate his art. The figure’s long legs support a voluptuous torso that recalls ancient fertility goddesses and a disproportionally small waist that accentuates her ample hips and breasts. Modernists like Lachaise were fascinated by preclassical art because they believed it possessed a primitive vitality absent from later art forms.",1346.0,"Artist

"Red Plank, 1969, John McCracken","John McCracken was a pioneering figure of West Coast Minimalism in the 1960s, when many California artists were concerned with issues of light and color. Having begun his career as a painter, he moved toward a more object-based aesthetic, making abstract works in the form of basic geometric shapes such as cubes or quadratic volumes. In 1966 he developed what became his signature sculptural forms: tall, leaning planks made of wood, coated in fiberglass, and then painted with a highly finished lacquer. Striking in their monolithic simplicity and characterized by pure, monochromatic surfaces, McCracken’s handcrafted “planks,” which rest on the floor and lean against the wall, successfully blur the boundary between painting and sculpture.",1348.0,"Artist

"Red Plank, 1969, John McCracken","John McCracken is considered a Minimalist sculptor with a singularly spiritual bent. He lacquered basic geometric volumes to lustrous effect, and California car culture often motivated his color choices (cars were “mobile color chips,” he once said), but he strove to make objects that were also “hallucinatory” or “other-wordly.” From 1966 forward McCracken’s signature form was the vividly monochrome “plank,” of which Red Plank is a prime example—stately, monolithic, yet leaning casually against the gallery wall.These sleek sculptures exist “between two worlds,” the artist explained, “the floor representing the physical world of standing objects, trees, cars, buildings, human bodies … and the wall representing the world of the imagination, illusionist painting space, [and] human mental space.”",1348.0,"Artist
