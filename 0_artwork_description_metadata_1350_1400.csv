"Helmet Mask (Kponyungo), Mid–19th/mid–20th century, Senufo","Among the Senufo, poro is the generic name for age-grade associations whose functions include interceding with supernatural forces, honoring ancestors, and educating young people. The many elements of composite horizontal masks called kponyungo portray powerful spirits that escort the deceased to the other world and protect the community from supernatural danger. Expressing its potency in that realm, this mask’s animal references include a crocodile’s jaw, a hyena’s snout, and horns of both a ram and an antelope.",1350.0,"Culture

"Self-Portrait, 1944, Beauford Delaney","In this vividly colored self-portrait, Beauford Delaney represented his likeness with a vibrant yet haunting intensity.The son of a Tennessee preacher, Delaney studied art in Boston before settling in 1929 in New York, where he became a familiar fixture in the downtown art scene, befriending such Abstract Expressionist artists as Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. Using bold, thick strokes of paint to render his features, Delaney projected a penetrating, uncompromising view of himself, suggesting an intensive scrutiny of his psyche as well as his appearance. The visionary power of this self-portrait shares many qualities with the expressionistic work of Pollock from this time.",1351.0,"Artist

"Mid American, 1969, Ed Paschke","Ed Paschke was a member of the late-1960s Chicago Imagist movement, a group of artists whose expressive style of figurative painting was rooted in outsider art, popular culture, and Surrealism. Their art added heat to Pop Art’s cool aesthetic. Mid American, an early painting that Paschke reworked several times, exemplifies the artist’s characteristic style, which utilized luminous, electric colors and fantastic imagery, yet remained rooted in a gritty realism. The confrontational, satin-robed athlete appears playfully otherworldly, with enlarged wing-tipped spats—a significant precursor to Paschke’s later shoe paintings—that emerge like butterfly wings behind his shoulders. The inscription on his shorts, Our Cover—like the tattoo on his chest, the mask on his face, the baseball mitts that float next to him, and his athletic attire—suggests the social markings used to conceal, protect, and layer a middleclass, middle-American identity.",1357.0,"Artist

"White Negress II, 1928, Constantin Brancusi","Constantin Brâncusi’s art focused not only on the medium and form of his sculptures, but also on the relationships between his works and the light and space around them. His atelier became the site of groundbreaking experimentation, as he regularly combined and recombined the component parts of individual works and rearranged their placement within groups. The complete ensemble of Brâncusi’s White Negress II unites the natural elements of stone and wood into an exploration of modern, abstract form, weight, and mass balanced with great lightness and delicacy. The artist avoided having a dealer and instead preferred to show his work to clients and friends in his studio. By the 1950s, his groupings were so critical to his aesthetic goals that he began to refuse to sell his works so that they could remain in their carefully orchestrated installations.",1358.0,"Artist

"Good Boy Bad Boy, 1985, Bruce Nauman","Bruce Nauman is a wildly influential artist whose work has explored the poetics of confusion, anxiety, boredom, entrapment, and failure since the 1960s. Nauman was a key figure in the experimental film and video movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s with such works as Dance or Exercise Around the Perimeter of a Square (Square Dance). After 1973, film and video become conspicuously absent from his work, replaced largely by language-based neon sculptures. He returned to video more than a decade later, with Good Boy Bad Boy. Of this decision, the artist recalled, “I think it’s because I had this information that I didn’t want to put into a neon sign… . I had thought about presenting it as a performance, but I have never felt comfortable with performance. And so video seemed to be a way to do it.” Conceived as a didactic moral statement, the installation employs two actors, Joan Lancaster and Tucker Smallwood, who are presented in close-up, like newscasters, on two separate monitors. Each recites a one-hundred-line commentary on the human condition that includes passages such as “I was a good boy/You were a good boy/We were good boys” and “I hate/You hate/We hate/This is hating.” Directly confronting the viewer, they deliver each repetition with increased emotional intensity, shifting in and out of sync with one another.",1359.0,"Artist

"The Second Part of the Return from Parnassus, 1961, Cy Twombly","Cy Twombly often titled his early 1960s works with florid evocations of art, myth, and allegory. These paintings, for example, refer to Mount Parnassus, the fabled home of Apollo and the Muses, which became known as the center of poetry, music, and learning in ancient Greece. These early paintings mix regular, system-based forms, numbers, and grids together with irregular, nature-based pictograms and suggestive or intuitive references to corporeal processes—sexual and otherwise. These are aspects of a general practice in which Twombly juxtaposes such marks to connote the dualities of mind and body. In their exuberant scale and color, the artist’s works of 1961 also reflect his response to the great architectural spaces of Rome, embracing the city’s grandeur and decadence in its ancient, Baroque, and modern incarnations.",1365.0,"Artist

"Garniture for Field and Foot Tourney at the Barriers, c. 1575","In the 16th century, Italian armorers produced spectacular armor garnitures for noblemen, professional officers, and bodyguards in the service of princely courts. An armor garniture consisted of many matching, interchangeable pieces that could be added or removed from basic field armor to make it suitable for different occasions. Like jousting armor, this armor for foot tourneys at the barriers—a sporting event in which knights on foot approached each other on opposite sides of a barrier—is quite specialized. It includes a close helmet that locked onto and rotated on the gorget (collar) and asymmetrical pauldrons (shoulder defenses) that provided maneuverability and protection from thrusting across the barrier. The blemish on the helmet of this armor, just above the eye slit, is the result of a glancing blow. This armor, embellished with gilded radiating bands contrasted with steel bands, as well as the Three-Quarter Armor, belonged to the Spanish Marquesses de Dos Aguas.",1376.0,"Title

In Woman with a Bird Cage, the influence of Cubism is apparent in Tamayo’s depiction of the woman’s body, which has been fractured into planes of color. Yet her distinctive elongated ear, large nose, open mouth, and the other aspects of her physiognomy reflect the artist’s study of Pre-Columbian art. Although Tamayo, unlike his countrymen Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco, did not address overtly social themes in his paintings, his references to the ancient and indigenous art forms of his country suggest that his art was no less concerned with aspects of Mexican identity.",1379.0,"Artist

Impeccably composed, with rich and varied textures and forms, his images range from unpeopled streets, parks, and monuments to cafes, street vendors, and shop windows. In Boulevard de Strasbourg (Corsets), rows of hourglass-shaped busts emerge out of darkness, while a dangling corset swings in the cracked doorway, animating the entire scene (Atget’s old-fashioned camera often recorded moving objects as blurred). Atget sold these cultural documents for modest sums to artists, craftspeople, and institutions interested in preserving the past.

"Life-Size Black Bass, 1904, Winslow Homer","In January 1904, Homer traveled to Homosassa, Florida, to fish. The Homosassa River, on the gulf side of the state, was home to many fish species and supported a lush wildlife habitat. It was in Homosassa that Homer painted his final tropical watercolors, including Life-Size Black Bass. In this work, the artist placed the underside of the huge, brightly colored fish at center and close to the viewer, bringing alive the drama, immediacy, and excitement of the fisherman’s experience as his fly, a “scarlet ibis,” hangs in the air. With trademark ambiguity, Homer presented the bass suspended between life and death. Will it succeed in grabbing its bright target only to seal its fate? The fish’s sudden jump slices through the dark, quiet jungle with a momentary flash of life and color.
In order to force the viewer into the path of the leaping fish, Homer cropped three centimeters off the lower edge of Life-Size Black Bass. He then centered and framed the fish for maximum effect by trimming a total of 2 centimeters from the right and left edges. The sheet dimensions are 350 x 526 millimeters; the original sheet dimensions were 380 x 545 millimeters as compared with uncut sheets of the same paper type. The trimmed edges appear slightly uneven and lack any adhesive residue from the watercolor paper block. As in a photograph with a short focal length, Homer presented the fish in tight focus against a vague and fluid background. With these compositional choices Homers heightened the tension of the strong, vital bass, frozen in motion, before capture and death. Such dramatic psychological impact results from Homer’s three decades of persistent observation using watercolor to transcribe nature on paper.",1392.0,"Artist

"Virgin and Child, 1460/65, Workshop of Rogier van der Weyden","Combining tenderness and regal authority, Rogier van der Weyden’s influential compositions of the Virgin and Child were repeated and varied by the master, his workshop, and by later Netherlandish painters. Here the Virgin supports the Child on a cushion that appears to rest on the edge of the picture’s frame, as though revealing the infant to the viewer through a window opening. Van der Weyden used elements such as the gems decorating the Virgin’s dress, her pearl-studded circlet, and the thronelike associations of the rich red velvet hanging behind her to characterize her as the queen of heaven. At the same time, by depicting her nurturing her infant, the artist emphasized Christ’s human nature and the Virgin’s role as an intercessor for mankind.",1397.0,"Artist

"Eviscerated Corpse, 1989, Mike Kelley","Mike Kelley’s work takes pleasure in perversion and embraces bad taste. Many of his early sculptures employ secondhand dolls and stuffed animals. Used, soiled, and discarded, Kelley’s toys violate the sentimental association of youth with innocence. Eviscerated Corpse, from his series Half a Man, is one of the artist’s bestknown objects. Its cartoonish horror presents childhood as pathology: dolls and stuffed animals lack sexual specificity, which perhaps reflects the desire of adults to maintain the chastity of children. Kelley said that “the stuffed animal is a pseudo-child, a cutified sexless being which represents the adult’s perfect model of a child—a neutered pet.” His icon of childhood is a hypersexualized monster, with the tiny doll either spilling its intestines, giving birth, or both.",1399.0,"Artist
