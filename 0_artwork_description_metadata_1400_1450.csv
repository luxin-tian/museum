"Boy with Pitcher (La Régalade), 1862/72, Édouard Manet","X-radiographs have revealed that this painting is a fragment of Les Gitanes, a large portrait of a gypsy family exhibited by Édouard Manet in 1863 and 1867. Apparently dissatisfied with his complex imitation of Spanish Baroque art, he cut the original painting into three sections and reconceived this portion as an individual work of art. The artist painted out part of the head of a female gypsy, replaced blue sky with a dark brown ground, and extensively reworked the figure of the boy. He then renamed the painting La Régalade, which means to pour liquid from a bottle down the throat without touching the lips.",1409.0,"Artist

"Statue of a Seated Woman, 2nd century AD, Ancient Roman","Roman sculptors often adapted the forms of earlier Greek artworks for use in entirely new contexts. This statue evokes the figures of seated, draped goddesses displayed in the pediments of the Parthenon, the renowned temple on the Acropolis in Athens. Among the Romans, this statue type was widely used for sculptures of female deities such as Juno (the Greek Hera), the consort of Jupiter (the Greek Zeus), as well as for portraits of empresses and other prominent women. Here the figure’s head and arms, now missing, were made separately and attached by means of dowels, the holes for which are visible.",1410.0,"Culture

The yellow half-circle at the top could represent the sun, one of Dove’s favorite subjects, and the areas of green and brown may be the earth below. When he exhibited this work in 1942 at An American Place, Dove published a poem in the catalogue, which includes the lines “There is much to be done— / Works of nature are abstract. / They do not lean on other things for meanings.” The title of this painting sums up Dove’s artistic project over the four decades of his career: to capture the abstraction of nature by creating “a reasonable facsimile” of its appearance.",1411.0,"Artist

"Brooklyn Bridge, 1899, Henry Ward Ranger","Although best known for his bucolic views of the countryside near his Connecticut home, New York City was Henry Ward Ranger’s primary place of residence, and the artist found inspiration in the urban environment. In Brooklyn Bridge he recorded one of the greatest icons of modernity. Completed in 1883, this impressive structure was still the longest suspension bridge in the world when Ranger painted it sixteen years later. Yet instead of emphasizing its massive scale or modern construction the artist produced a fairly traditional view, integrating the bridge into the landscape. The painting displays a rich luminosity through Ranger’s method of layering applications of paint and using transparent glazes.",1424.0,"Artist

"Virgin and Child Crowned by Angels, 1490/95, Colyn de Coter","Colyn de Coter directed a workshop in Brussels well into the 16th century, but his style and subjects reflect the traditions of the great 15th-century Netherlandish painters Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck, and Rogier van der Weyden. Here the well-appointed, bourgeois interior underscores Christ’s humanity, even as angels crown the Virgin as the Queen of Heaven. Like his predecessors, De Coter used details of the setting to emphasize both the human and divine aspects of Christ’s nature. Thus, the lion carved on the arm of Mary’s chair alludes to the biblical throne of Solomon, and the prayer inscribed on the hem of her cloak hails her as ""mother of the king of angels.""

"Portrait of Joaneta Obrador, 1918, Joan Miró","This painting belongs to a group of fascinating and highly individual works by Joan Miró that document his early efforts to grapple with revolutionary developments in modern art (such as Fauvism and Cubism) and to forge his own direction. These efforts culminated in the early 1920s in the artist’s breakthrough to a style of fantastic, simplified forms, freely and loosely scattered across the surface of his pictures with an exuberant abandon that is hard to imagine based on this tightly constructed portrait. And yet, something of this exuberance—of the vitality and poetic intensity of Miró‘s later works—seems indeed to underly this strangely powerful portrait, manifesting itself, for example, in the unrestrained rhythms of the dress, barely held in check by the diamond grid in the background, or in the lyrical note introduced by the small flower on the front of the dress.
Different and often contrasting impulses are brought here into uneasy balance through the sheer force of Miró’s talent for creating compelling simplifications of the forms before him. The strong rhythms established by the dress, wallpaper, and face all vie for attention, as do the artist’s various sources of inspiration: the influence of the Fauves and especially of Henri Matisse in the bold use of color, dense application of paint, and flat patterning of the dress and background; the effect of Cubism in the far more sculptural, angular treatment of the face; and the impact of the Romanesque frescoes of Miró’s native Catalonia (which the artist himself acknowledged as a major inspiration) in the linear rhythms of the dress, hair, and background, in the frontal pose, and in the large, staring eyes. This is a painting of dramatic contrasts, between the insistent flatness of the dress and back-ground and the Cubist modeling of the face, between the startling pink of the wallpaper and the restrained black-and-white color scheme of the dress, between the human presence of the sitter and the strong linear patterns that threaten to engulf it. It does not seem surprising, given the impact this portrait still has today, that the young woman who initially agreed to sit for it became frightened both by Miró’s intensity and his strange style of painting, forcing him to finish the portrait from memory.",1427.0,"Artist

"Supervielle, Large Banner Portrait, 1945, Jean Dubuffet","Jean Dubuffet had a vast knowledge of classical art and culture, but he sought a new path for his art based outside Western artistic conventions. He became a proponent of art brut (raw art), an anti-aesthetic inspired by the art of children, the mentally ill, prisoners, and those “unscathed by artistic culture, where mimicry plays little or no part.” In his quest for a dynamic, expressive, and authentic style, Dubuffet developed a technique of scratching into thickly impastoed paint surfaces, often mixed with materials from the earth, to produce raw, graffiti-like images. This painting of the poet Jules Supervielle comes from a series of crude portraits of Parisian writers and intellectuals that the artist made from his imagination, depersonalizing and transforming his subjects into caricatures of human types.",1429.0,"Artist

"Landscape with Smokestacks, c. 1890, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","Degas is best known for his images of the ballet and other scenes from modem urban life. However, periodically he explored the landscape genre, with a trip in 1869 to the Normandy Coast, for example, that resulted in a number of pastel landscapes. During the peak years of Impressionism-the 1870s and 1880s, when landscape reigned supreme among France’s avant-garde-Degas was notoriously averse to the practice of open-air landscape painting. Yet in the 1890s, he produced several groups of landscapes, combining observation and invention in various ways. The artist’s renewed interest was prompted by a trip he took he took through Burgundy in 1890 that inspired him to treat its landscape using the technique of monotype. A monotype is made by painting or drawing an image in greasy printer ‘s ink on a metal plate and then printing the plate onto a sheet of paper. Only one strong impression can usually be pulled from the plate; on occasion, a second, paler impression known as a monotype cognate can be pulled as well. Degas sometimes completed pastels over monotypes or monotype, cognates, as in Landscape with Smokestacks. He pioneered this technique in the 1870s. He began some of his monotypes on the spot, while others-possibly Landscape with Smokestacks-were recollections. Certainly, Degas’s aim in such compositions was quite different from his colleague Claude Monet’s preoccupation with changing atmospheric effects. While rooted in experience, Degas’s landscapes of memory are brooding and mysterious.",1431.0,"Artist

"Grey and Silver: Old Battersea Reach, 1863, James McNeill Whistler","James McNeill Whistler painted marine subjects throughout his career. For several years beginning in 1855, the expatriate American artist divided his time between London and Paris; in the latter, he was exposed to the bold realism and thickly impastoed surfaces of the paintings of Gustave Courbet. The older artist’s influence shaped Whistler’s depiction of the Thames River, a subject that frequently appeared in his work after he moved to London in 1863. In this painting, he focused on the river’s industrial nature—boats and barges, laboring men, and smoking chimneys—which featured so largely in urban life. Yet despite the realism of the subject, Whistler unified the composition with deft brushwork and a subtle palette of brown and gray that anticipates his later interest in delicate tonal harmonies.",1435.0,"Artist

He taught at the Bauhaus for most of the famed school’s existence; initially head of the bookbinding department, he also supervised the glass-painting workshop. His greatest influence, however, was as a lecturer for the basic design course on the theory of form in art. In lectures, Klee developed his ideas about the ""polyphony"" of painting, which was based on his interest in simultaneous sensational effects that could be created by various layered formal elements. He believed that this type of creative experimentation could ""issue forth a transformed beholder of art"" and thus pave the way for total abstraction.",1442.0,"Artist

The Northern European artists Käthe Kollwitz and Edvard Munch drew on personal experiences for their devastating images of loss, seen here in stark scenes of grief. Kollwitz and the caricaturist Honoré Daumier (in an unusually somber mood) used similar iconographies of partially exposed corpses to make political statements: Daumier criticized the contemporary French government’s excessive response to a lower class riot in his Rue Transnonian, while Kollwitz drew on her own socialist sympathies in evoking war horrors in Raped, part of her series about the disastrous 1525 German Peasants’ War. The scattered feet of the family members in Daumier’s Transnonian and the nearly invisible child’s head to the left of Kollwitz’s splayed female body remind the viewer of these scenes’ universal themes.",1446.0,"Artist
