"Head of a Damned Soul from Dante’s “Inferno,” (verso), 1770/78, Henry Fuseli","Born into a family of artists in Zurich, Henry Fuseli lived in Italy from 1770 to 1778. He probably painted this head, as well as the one executed with equally loose brushwork on the reverse of the canvas, as a study for his own use. Both images were also engraved as illustrations for Johann Caspar Lavater’s influential book on physiognomy (the science of facial structure). According to the text, the heads were inspired by damned souls in Dante Alighieri’s epic poem Inferno. Throughout his career, Fuseli favored heroic subjects taken from the work of Dante, John Milton, and William Shakespeare, and he drew formal inspiration from Michelangelo, whom he equated with his literary heroes.",1451.0,"Artist

"Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), also known as The Great Wave, from the series “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjurokkei)”, 1830/33, Katsushika Hokusai","Katsushika Hokusai’s much celebrated series, Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjûrokkei), was begun in 1830, when the artist was 70 years old. This tour-de-force series established the popularity of landscape prints, which continues to this day. Perhaps most striking about the series is Hokusai’s copious use of the newly affordable Berlin blue pigment, featured in many of the compositions in the color for the sky and water. Mount Fuji is the protagonist in each scene, viewed from afar or up close, during various weather conditions and seasons, and from all directions.",1452.0,"Artist

"Stowing Sail, 1903, Winslow Homer","Homer created sparkling watercolor sketches of sailboats in Bahamian waters during his 1898-99 Bahamas trip. When he visited Key West, Florida, in the winter of 1903-04, he further indulged his interest in the details of local boating. There, Homer painted Stowing Sail on December 22, 1903. Everything about this watercolor points toward rapid, plein-air execution.
The artist’s graphite underdrawing is a quick and sketchy series of lines that establish the major contours on the sheet. Pentiments, or shifts, in the underdrawing show that when he began the sketch, the figure was leaning further forward, gathering the sail over the back of the boat. This adjustment suggests that Homer was working quickly to keep up with the man’s progress.
Homer applied all of his washes directly within the forms marked in the underdrawing, working wet-on-wet, as if there were not enough time to wait for one to dry before adding the next. When he brushed the heavy, red stroke at the front of the boat, it bled upward into the still-wet blue shadow on the side.",1457.0,"Artist

His early work in the 1960s took the form of brightly painted plaster reliefs and sculptures of foodstuffs and other commercial products. Later the canvas props that Oldenburg had sewn for earlier performancebased events led to large-scale soft sculptures. By the mid-1960s, the artist turned his attention to drawings and proposals for outdoor monuments—some imaginary, some real.

"Lekythos (Oil Jar), About 445/440 BC, Achilles Painter","Athenian cemeteries housed a variety of monuments and offerings to the dead. This terracotta vessel, called a lekythos, is one example that held oil. From the middle until the end of the fifth century B.C., they were usually decorated in a distinctive technique known as white ground, so called after the light slip coating on the body and shoulder of the vase. Atop this, figures were usually drawn in outline and then painted in rich colors, many of which have since faded. Since most of these bottles were made for burial with the dead or to be left at their graves, the scenes on their surfaces typically represent tombs, visitors to tombs, and farewell scenes.",1461.0,"Artist

"Virgin and Child with Two Angels, 1485/95, Sandro Botticelli","Sandro Botticelli’s works mark the culmination of a mystical religious tradition in the art of early Renaissance Florence, from the paintings of Lorenzo Monaco and Fra Angelico through those of Fra Filippo Lippi, Botticelli’s teacher. In this lyrical late work by Botticelli, two angels draw back curtains to reveal the Virgin and Child, who are framed by slender trees in a setting suggesting a throne. The intimate presentation of the holy figures and Christ’s gesture of blessing suggest that this small painting served a private devotional function. This supposition is supported by the choice of format, since a Florentine patron would have typically commissioned a circular painting, or tondo, for use in a bedchamber.",1467.0,"Artist

"Alex, 1991, Chuck Close","Since the late 1960s, the pioneering Realist artist Chuck Close has used the human face, tightly framed, as the basis for his art. In 1987 the artist made 24-x-20-inch Polaroid portraits of several fellow artists, which he then turned into studies for oil paintings. Two years later, he suffered a collapsed spinal artery, which severely limited his mobility and confined him to a wheelchair. With great determination, Close regained his former control of his medium, as this monumental portrait of the artist Alex Katz demonstrates. Like much of his recent work, it is less an exact likeness than an exploration of process. Incremental blips of paint—circles, dots, and dashes—are laid into a grid corresponding to the original photographic study.",1469.0,"Artist

"Woman at Her Toilette, 1900/05, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","Images of women washing themselves are ubiquitous in the history of Western art. The female nude in general has long been considered one of the most important subjects of artistic expression, most importantly in the form of history painting, traditionally represented in classical or biblical subjects. However, in the late 19th century progressive artists spurned traditional history painting in favor of contemporary subject matter—art of the moment that represented real life. The artists featured in this gallery made the theme of the bathing woman thoroughly modern. During this period, public health officials encouraged regular bathing not only for cosmetic reasons, but also as a means to combat diseases such as cholera. As a result, more and more people washed indoors regularly. The images in this gallery by Edgar Degas, Félix Vallotton, Pierre Bonnard, and Suzanne Valadon, for example, show modern accouterments of indoor plumbing—large porcelain tubs and taps for running water. Though these prints and drawings allude to contemporary industrial developments and evolving societal expectations, they remain principally devoid of narrative. They depict anonymous women across a range of social classes, including some models who were probably prostitutes, in the intimate act of washing. These artists used the subject of the bathing woman as an evocative means to an end—especially Degas, who returned to the theme of the bather literally hundreds of times between the late 1870s and his death in 1917. Degas utilized bathers to explore the possibilities of the human form—employing multiple angles and viewpoints, depicting its shape and various movements, and reflecting the many colors and textures of the environment.",1483.0,"Artist

"Three Men Carrying a Wounded Soldier, from the Images of Spain, Album F, 1812/20, Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes","Goya’s bold watercolor is very far from the emphasis on pure line of the restrained Classicism that characterizes many of the works from this period. Goya applied his washes with an abandon that verged on the abstract. Indeed, it can be difficult to separate the knot of individual figures, three of them carrying a fourth, in a scene that recalls images of the Deposition of Christ. Probably produced during the Spanish War of Independence against Napoleonic France (1808–14), Goya’s drawing unflinchingly treats the senseless violence and social chaos that defined the period.",1485.0,"Artist

"Anacreon with the Infants Bacchus and Cupid, modeled 1878 (cast c. 1893), Jean Léon Gérôme","Jean-Léon Gérôme initially gained fame as a painter of classical and oriental subjects, turning to sculpture relatively late in his career. One of his early paintings was based on a poem by the fifth-century Greek poet Anacreon, who received Bacchus, the god of wine, and Cupid, the god of love, in his house. Gérôme later returned to this subject in a plaster that was first exhibited in 1881. It was subsequently turned into a full-scale marble statue (now in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen). The composition proved popular enough for reproduction as a small bronze, and this example was presented to the Art Institute by the bronze foundry Barbedienne on the occasion of the Columbian Exposition of 1893.",1486.0,"Artist

He applied thin layers of paint in muted tones to evoke the flattened appearance of Japanese woodblock prints. The composition also recalls the work of the Spanish Baroque master, Diego Velázquez.
