"Garniture for Field and Foot Tourney at the Barriers, c. 1575","Chivalry—with its connotation of the knightly ideal—was intimately connected with the horse (cheval in French). A knight took care to protect his mount, on which he was dependent for the mobility and speed required in both attack and retreat. In Roman times, some heavy cavalry used armor made of iron or bronze scales to protect their horses. From the twelth century on, knights covered their steeds in bands of iron mail (a network of interlocking rings). By the fifteenth century, full-plate armors were not uncommon. This shaffron, or headpiece, is etched in gilt bands with decoration on a finely dotted ground. Riveted between the eyes is an elongated conical spike, perhaps inspired by the horn of the mythical unicorn. A manifestation of great power and wealth, the shaffron has been valued for centuries as an object of beauty, not just as a tool of warfare and sport.",1603.0,"Title

"Friendship Quilt, 1842, Ella Maria Deacon","Inscribed with names and verses, the eighty-five unique squares of this quilt bear signs of friendship and community. Made in an era when communication and travel required significant time and effort, the quilt may have served as a farewell gift on the eve of the recipient’s marriage and ensuing move. In one square, an M. C. Coles simply wrote Remember me. In another, Martha Buzby composed a short poem: Oft in tender recollection / Call to mind thine absent friend / Cherish for her that affection / Which I trust will never end. These clever, succinctly rendered compositions add a metaphorical layer of coziness to the quilt and allowed Deacon to keep those dear always near.

"Head of Medusa, c. 1801, Antonio Canova","The great Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova dominated the artistic scene in Rome at the turn of the 19th century. This bust represents a partial study for his marble statue Perseus Holding the Head of Medusa (1797–1801). The face of Medusa, a monster from Greek mythology, had the power to petrify anyone who beheld it. Canova expressed the horror of Medusa’s appearance and her death throes in this decapitated head. The sculptor initially modeled the work in clay, subsequently making a plaster mold of it. This preserved the freshness and spontaneity of the model while conveying a surface similar to the finished marble.",1621.0,"Artist

"Max Herrmann-Neisse, 1913, Ludwig Meidner","Though perhaps best known for his visionary, apocalyptic landscapes, Ludwig Meidner, like many German Expressionists, used portraiture to explore the inner emotional life of his subjects. ""Do not be afraid of the face of a human being,"" Meidner once said. ""Don’t let your pen stop until the soul of that one opposite you is wedded to yours in a covenant of pathos."" In addition to making self-portraits, Meidner painted many of Berlin’s literati, including the Expressionist poet and theater critic Max Herrmann-Neisse. The artist used the thick paint, energetic brushwork, and distorted form characteristic of Expressionist painting to communicate his subject’s inner vitality and psychological life.",1629.0,"Artist

"Maggie’s Brain, 1995, Christopher Wool","Since the 1980s Christopher Wool has critically examined the complexities of abstraction and representation through the use of techniques, processes, images, and language taken from popular and vernacular culture. In his reconsideration of the process of painting, Wool has expanded upon the conventions of the medium, employing dripping, overpainting, and erasure with techniques associated with printing and language production, as well as silkscreen and spray paint. In Maggie’s Brain, the aluminum support is silkscreened, overpainted with white, silkscreened a second time, and then topped with an explosive, floral-like spray
in the center. Multiple references—from the allover compositions of Abstract Expressionism to the cool, silkscreened surfaces of Pop Art—reflect Wool’s engagement with the history of painting.",1631.0,"Artist

"Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House, 1982, Bill Viola","For over thirty years, Bill Viola has created single-channel videos as well as sound and video installations that focus on spirituality and explore multiple levels of human consciousness. In constructing these works, the artist draws from his extensive study of Eastern and Western art, philosophy, and religion. He also consistently deploys cutting-edge technologies, investigating new ways to manipulate viewers’ perception. Both the videos in The Reflecting Pool and the installation Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House are important early works that foreshadow Viola’s later creations, combining philosophic inquiry with captivating physical environments.
The haunting Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House contains a solitary wood chair with headphones attached, facing a television monitor. Viola, looking visibly fatigued, appears on the screen, sitting in his own chair. Here, the artist compels viewers into an intimate relationship: they sit at eye level with him, listening to the sound of his breathing through the headphones. The silence and tension in the installation is disrupted at irregular intervals by a dissonant, jarring sound that echoes throughout the gallery. At the same time, Viola is hit over the head with a magazine. Taken as a whole, the work suggests a scene of execution or torture, with its single chair and its haggard artist, sleep-deprived and assaulted while seated alone in an empty room.
In both The Reflecting Pool and Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House, the artist urges viewers to become active participants. Of his work, Viola stated, “You’re a part of it. It’s not something that’s just a fixed projection from the past.”",1636.0,"Artist

"Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows: the Rainbow, 1834, David Lucas","The landscape painter John Constable owned an edition of J. M. W. Turner’s Liber Studiorum, which he famously referred to as the “liber stupidorum,” a critical remark directed at the ambitious size of the undertaking (of which only 71 of the planned 100 plates were finally printed), rather than its artistry. Constable nonetheless employed David Lucas’s considerable printmaking talents to immortalize 22 of his own paintings in mezzotint for a similarly scaled portfolio, English Landscape Scenery. They also collaborated on this larger plate, revising it until Constable’s death, as the artist agonized over every detail, explaining in a letter to Lucas: “If [the rainbow] is not tender—and elegant—evanescent and lovely … we are both ruined.”",1637.0,"Artist
