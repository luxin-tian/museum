"Abraham Lincoln, Modeled 1916, cast after 1916, Daniel Chester French","Lorado Taft praised Daniel Chester French as “the dean of American sculptors.” French specialized in large-scale marble statues, private memorials, and portrait busts. Here the sculptor captured Abraham Lincoln in a difficult hour of decision, and the president’s expression is more serious and thoughtful than in French’s earlier bronze of the standing Lincoln (1984.1130). This bronze is a reduced version of the full-size statue in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., which French worked on with the architect Henry Bacon. French’s brother, William M. R. French, was the first director of the Art Institute, serving from 1879 to 1914.",1654.0,"Artist

The tall, cylindrical cocktail shaker and stemmed cups that echo the shape and design of the shaker cap were sold with Norman Bel Geddes’s stepped serving tray to create a plazalike platform on which the cocktail service could be arranged like architectural elements. Although conceived as part of a set, the tray was retailed by Revere Copper and Brass, a company established by the Boston silversmith Paul Revere, a year before the shaker and goblets were released in 1936.

"Reminiscence of a Cathedral, 1920/23, Frantisek Kupka","Born in Bohemia (in the present-day Czech Republic), Frantisek Kupka immigrated to Paris in 1896, where he lived until his death. Kupka developed a unique path to pure abstraction. He combined his interests in Orphism, an offshoot of Cubism that focused on simultaneous color contrasts as equivalents of musical pitches, Slavic folk art, the decorative art of Islam, and new scientific inventions such as radiography. Theosophy—a synthesis of philosophy, religion, and science—also guided Kupka’s approach to art. Additionally, he studied the stained-glass windows of the Notre-Dame cathedrals in Paris and Chartres. Kupka’s desire to capture the feeling of light passing through colored glass led to a number of compositions on this theme, including Reminiscence of a Cathedral.",1663.0,"Artist

"For Juan Gris #7, c. 1954, Joseph Cornell","Cornell’s interest in the cubist artist Juan Gris prompted a series of boxes and several collages, as well as a dossier containing notes, cutout reproductions, and catalogues. At least fifteen boxes and several collages related to Gris have been identified by Lynda Roscoe Hartigan (see Anne d’Harnoncourt, “The Cubist Cockatoo: A Preliminary Exploration of Joseph Cornell‘s Homages to Juan Gris,” Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin 74 [June 1978, p. 6). The imagery of this series of boxes is tied both to Cornell’s bird boxes and to his Hotel Boxes. In boxes such as this one, Cornell showed an unusual and subtle response to Gris’s unique type of Cubist collage. This is particularly apparent when, as in this case, the white cockatoo that is so often the central feature in the Gris series is absent and only the outline remains, echoed by a black paper shadow more geometric in character than the outline itself. The play between representation and reality so central to Cubism is alluded to not just in the outline and shadow, and in the central cluster of forms of varying degree of abstraction, but also in the real wooden branch extending from the rear wall of the box-cage.",1673.0,"Artist

"For Juan Gris #7, c. 1954, Joseph Cornell","Here Cornell used a French newspaper text to cover the inside walls of the box, integrating it into the box’s surface by painting and pasting over it in a manner similar to Gris‘s. More generally, however, Gris’s persistent love of the particular shapes of his objects and his unexpected tenderness for the picturesque and romantic (see, for example, his 1914 Flowers, collection Hester Diamond, or his 1913 Guitar, Paris, Musée national d’art moderne, with its fragment of a sentimental nineteenth century print; ill. in London, Whitechapel Art Gallery, Juan Gris, 1992, exh. cat., nos. 44, 28, respectively) find an echo in Cornell. As Anne d’Harnoncourt noted, “The bits of newsprint, flowered and marbleized papers, or empty tobacco packets in Gris’s collages of 1913–14 have a keepsake quality quite unlike similar fragments incorporated into works by Picasso and Braque” (d’Harnoncourt 1978, p. 9).

"For Juan Gris #7, c. 1954, Joseph Cornell","This is not to argue an “influence” of a simple or direct kind. Cornell’s work is built on a series of responses and experiences of a peculiarly private nature. There is no obvious reason, for example, for Cornell‘s choice of a cockatoo as the emblem of his Gris Boxes. Music, so important to Cornell, may have provided the thread of connections here. It seems that he associated Gris with the nineteenth-century contralto Malibran, who like Gris died at a tragically young age, and was described as “the bird of song” by Hans Christian Andersen, whom Cornell also admired (Ashton 1974, p. 24, citing Monica Stirling, The Life and Times of Hans Christian Andersen, New York, 1965).",1673.0,"Artist

"For Juan Gris #7, c. 1954, Joseph Cornell","Although Cornell could well have been familiar with Gris’s work earlier (Curt Valentin’s Buchholz Gallery, New York, held an exhibition in 1950), it was the sight of Figure Seated in a Cafe (1914, Mr. and Mrs. Leigh B. Block; Cooper 1977,) in 1953 at the Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, that first seized his imagination. He wrote in retrospect, in 1961: “The so-called ‘Juan Gris’ boxes were not worked out slavishly —mechanically—from this collected material the original inspiration was purely a human reaction to a particular painting at the Janis Gallery—a man reading a newspaper at a cafe table covered almost completely by his reading material” (Cornell 1993, p. 285). Cornell’s interest in Gris, which lasted through the mid-1960s, experienced a renewal in the late 1950s with the large Gris retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1958, and the publication of John Golding’s Cubism: A History and an Analysis in 1959, to which he referred on several occasions in his diaries. Cornell‘s practice of working on a piece over a period of several years, or of leaving it fallow for a while, seems to be true of For Juan Gris #7. He wrote in a diary entry of January 1960 (Cornell 1993, p. 273): “1/24/60 Sunday Gris #7 / ‘creative’ reviewing / Gris #7 taken from storage in semi-unresolved difficult time—and then—miracle of unfoldment / appreciation / ‘treasure’” Whether Cornell implied here, through the use of one of his favorite words, “unfoldment,” that he resolved the work, or simply reviewed it and found it complete, remains uncertain.",1673.0,"Artist

"Rochas Mermaid Dress (Lisa Fonssagrives-Penn), Paris, 1950, printed June 1979, Irving Penn","In July 1950, Vogue magazine sent Irving Penn to Paris to document that year’s fall couture collections. Over the course of ten days, clothes by Balenciaga, Dior, Rochas, and others were rushed to an old top-floor studio, where Penn posed models against a discarded theater curtain. The resulting photographs, spread across two September issues, marked a stark departure from the elaborately staged sets favored by fashion photographers of the previous decade. Among the models, Lisa Fonssagrives was a standout—in 1949, at age 38, she had become the first model to grace the cover of Time magazine, earning the title “Billion-Dollar Baby.” The statuesque icon first captured Penn’s attention at a 1947 photo shoot, and in the years that followed she became his muse and collaborator.

"Equestrian and Four Figures, Probably late 12th/15th century, Bankoni","Terracotta figures like this set might have served a ritual purpose. The adornment on the figures, including the hairstyles and possible scarification marks, suggest sta- tus and wealth.

The descriptive term Bankoni derives from the village where archaeologists unearthed similar objects from the 1950s onward. Located near Bamako, Mali’s capital, this region is today inhabited by the Bamana people, whose ancestors are believed to have made works in a similar style.

"Peach Blossoms, 1878, Winslow Homer","Winslow Homer often depicted scenes of leisure in his early career. This painting features a young woman looking at burgeoning peach blossoms, indicating both early spring and perhaps her youth. The setting, which often recurs in Homer’s oeuvre, reflects nostalgia for a fading rural past. Contemporary critics referred to the artist’s style at this time as independent of foreign influences, suggesting an inherently American quality. However, his stylistic decisions link this work to both French and Japanese art. Impressionism inspired Homer’s use of a lighter palette, and the attention to linearity in the tree is reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy. The painting thus serves as visual evidence of the global artistic exchange of the late 19th century.",1685.0,"Artist

The Serf, one of Matisse’s earliest sculptures, consumed him: he was reported to have spent up to 500 sessions with his model, Bevilaqua, who also posed for Auguste Rodin. The Art Institute’s work is an early cast (1908) of a total edition of 10 and was once owned by Matisse’s most enthusiastic early supporters, Michael and Sarah Stein.",1691.0,"Artist

"Fragment of a Funerary Naiskos (Monument in the Shape of a Temple), about 330 BC, Ancient Greek","These three figures are chiseled so deeply into the stone that they, like the head of the man on the left, are carved nearly in the round. From the preserved portions of the males’ right arms, it is clear they were clasping hands—a gesture signifying farewell in funerary scenes. Their impassive expressions contrast with the poignant gaze and gesture of the woman in the center, who places her right hand, palm up, on the standing man’s shoulder. Perhaps he is the one who has died.",1695.0,"Culture

"The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters, plate 43 from Los Caprichos, 1797/99, Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes","Hovering between the grotesque and the comical, Francisco de Goya’s series Los caprichos (Whims or Fantasies) consists of 80 etchings satirizing Spanish society during the late 18th century. For this iconic image, which may have been intended as the title page of the series, Goya represented himself as an artist who has fallen asleep at his drawing table. In the background are his nightmares, the macabre tormenters that pervade the rest of these prints.",1696.0,"Artist
