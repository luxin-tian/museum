"Watering Place at Marly, 1875, Alfred Sisley","In 1875 Alfred Sisley moved to the village of Marly-le-Roi, so named because Louis XIV built an elegant country retreat there. The artist lived on the rue de l’Abreuvoir, which flanked the pool featured on the left of this canvas. The pool was all that remained of the water gardens that had been part of the king’s park. Of the original Impressionist group, Sisley remained most faithful to his early landscape subjects, spending most of his life painting in the villages along the Seine River, in the region referred to as the cradle of Impressionism.",1753.0,"Artist

"Têtes-paysage, 1928, Francis Picabia","Têtes-paysage (Heads-landscape) belongs to Picabia’s “Transparency” series, a group of works so named for the artist’s use of multilayered, transparent images. In the dreamlike tableaux of the transparencies, Picabia referenced visual sources ranging from ancient Rome to the Renaissance, often juxtaposing the sacred with the profane. These works draw on mythology, religion, and conventions of beauty and, in their blending of the unexpected, project a distinctly Surrealist sensibility. As much as they reflect the traditional world, however, they also mirror modern times: indeed, Picabia derived his simultaneous, nonhierarchical use of images from his experiments in film, especially his 1924 masterpiece with René Clair, Entr’acte.",1754.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Forgotten Game), c. 1949, Joseph Cornell","The Forgotten games are among the most evocative of Cornell’s boxes, and the Bergman version is perhaps the most completely realized of them all. There are evidently links here with the Dovecote series, but the primary reference is to games and toys, which had an enduring fascination for Cornell. As is often the case with Cornell‘s work, the active involvement of the spectator is invited. This box is not a purely visual game; it also moves and makes sounds. As noted in the media description, through a small trapdoor in the upper right side of the box, a ball can be rolled down a series of ramps to hit five yellow bells hung above the ramps, which the ball rings as it passes, finally hitting the silver bell visible through the cracked pane of glass at the bottom right. This last bell rings with a faint, flawed note as though penetrating a fog at sea. Five rows of six circular holes each are cut into the wood front of the box, which is painted an ivory white and weathered to look like a neglected birdhouse. Cornell devised various ways of purposefully aging surfaces, and the flaking of the paint here, like the cracked glass, is intentional. The holes are smallest at the beginning of each slope and increase in size, as it were, in pace with the growing noise of the ball gathering speed as it descends each ramp in turn.",1755.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Forgotten Game), c. 1949, Joseph Cornell","Sounds are essential to this box: both the rumbling of the rolling ball and the periodic tinkling of the bells. ‘Writing about this work, Diane Waldman recalled Max Ernst quoting Leonardo da Vinci, “like the tinkling of a bell, which makes one hear that which one imagines” (Max Ernst, “Au dela de la peinture,” Cahiers d’art 2, 6 – 7 [1936], n. pag.; cited in Waldman 1977, p. 26). One is also reminded of the continuous ringing of a bell in Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel’s film L’Age d’or (1929), throughout the scene in which the young woman gazes into a mirror and dreams of the man she loves. In this box, Cornell used sound as vividly as he did visual and kinetic elements to invoke memory.",1755.0,"Artist

"Shepherd Resting in a Clearing, 1849, Henri Joseph Harpignies","While most etchings are created in the intaglio process whereby the etched lines hold ink, in this print by Harpignies, the work is printed like a woodcut, a relief process. Here the surface of the plate was covered with black ink and printed as a relief so that the etched lines, which do not hold ink, appear white. This was an unusual process to be used in the nineteenth century and was likely done by the artist as a technical experiment.",1765.0,"Artist

"Western Industrial, 1955, Charles Sheeler","Often associated with the American artistic group known as the Precisionists, Charles Sheeler was both a painter and a photographer. This late work, Western Industrial, depicts the Inland Steel plant in East Chicago, Indiana. Evident here is the artist’s interest in line and overlapping shapes, his restrained painting style, and his use of subdued color. The many diagonals leading the eye to various points in the composition give the impression of an active industry; however, the plant is devoid of humans. Indeed, a critic once referred to one of Sheeler’s works as a “depopulated landscape.”",1766.0,"Artist

"Brilliant Gloom, 2004, Michael Raedecker","Often depicting unsettling yet strangely familiar locations, Michael Raedecker’s atmospheric paintings layer embroidery over muted planes of color. Applying pale washes of pigment “drawn” over with thread, he creates a sparse framework onto which he builds up isolated patches of detail. Brilliant Gloom depicts a view of a house in a murky, seemingly cosmic landscape with stitched-on plants and rocks that appear to float above the ground. A radiant grid of brightly colored lights hovers above the shadowy vista, vaguely reflected in the water. The gleaming colored lamps pierce the dull haze of the surrounding sky, resulting in a glowing cloud of color and light in an otherwise bleak environment—perhaps the remaining vestige of a party after the guests and host have departed or even something more supernatural.",1767.0,"Artist

"Amphora (Storage Jar), about 530/520 BC, Ancient Etruscan","Etruscan artists, no doubt eager to capitalize on the high demand for Greek vases, and perhaps also hoping to attract customers unable to afford the imported wares, set up a workshop, probably at Vulci, to produce facsimiles of the Athenian vases. This vessel’s attenuated proportions and symmetrical profile create an especially elegant shape that belies the somewhat coarse texture of the local Etruscan clay from which it is made. The clay’s poor quality also stymied attempts to replicate the highly refined surface finishes of Athenian vases. Nevertheless, the painter of this vase skillfully composed his scenes within trapezoidal picture fields bounded above by a decorative pattern of interlacing lotus buds and dots and along its sides by a single line. On the front, a hound looks back at a horse and hunter, while a stag and hare flee for their lives on the back.",1771.0,"Culture

"Le Grenouillard (Frog-Man), 1892, Jean-Joseph Carriès","During his short but brilliant career, Jean-Joseph Carriès explored alternative sculptural media such as ceramics and plaster, which were considered vastly inferior to marble and bronze. His works draw upon themes from Japanese art and Social Darwinism, none more impressively than his late masterpiece Le Grenouillard. The squat figure with bulging eyes and an elongated spine appears to be half man, half amphibian, yet he could also be likened to a netsuke, a whimsical Japanese carving, but on a grand scale.",1773.0,"Artist

"Coast of Maine, 1893, Winslow Homer","Winslow Homer observed the shoreline in various weather conditions and seasons after moving to live in near isolation in Prouts Neck, Maine, in 1883. Amid the remote and dramatic landscape, he depicted seascapes void of human life, focusing instead on an emotional response to nature. His marine scenes are larger than his earlier works, the size of the canvases emphasize the vastness and power of the sea. Homer alluded to the violence of water through the sharply diagonal shoreline and vigorous brushwork. The flat areas of color that he employed to represent the rugged rocks simultaneously hint at abstraction.",1780.0,"Artist

"Saint John the Baptist in Prison Visited by Two Disciples, 1455/60, Giovanni di Paolo","Giovanni di Paolo worked within the conservative artistic tradition of Siena, creating rich patterns and an intensely devotional mood in his paintings. Among his finest narrative works are these six panels, part of a series of twelve depicting the life of Saint John the Baptist, the kinsman and prophet of Christ. Other panels from the series are scattered in European and American collections; they may originally have formed the doors of a shrine housing a relic of the saint. In the first of the Art Institute’s panels, the young Baptist enters the wilderness to live as a hermit; later he foretells Christ’s role as redeemer, is imprisoned, and is finally martyred at the request of Salome, the step-daughter of King Herod.",1784.0,"Artist
