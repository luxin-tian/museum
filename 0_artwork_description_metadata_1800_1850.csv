"Daniel Hubbard, 1764, John Singleton Copley","Between 1753 and 1774—when he departed the colonies for England because of the Loyalist sympathies of his wife’s family—John Singleton Copley painted 350 portraits, primarily of Bostonians. Copley received his only formal art training from his stepfather Peter Pelham, an English graphics artist who specialized in mezzotint engraving. Pelham encouraged the aspiring artist to produce his own mezzotints and to learn to draw by copying English prints. By the time Daniel Hubbard (1764) and Mrs. Daniel Hubbard (Mary Greene) (c. 1764) were produced, Copley had established a popular portrait style featuring individualized faces and luxurious fabrics. The poses of his figures derive from mezzotints of fashionable English portraits.",1803.0,"Artist

"Man of Sorrows, 1950, Marion Perkins","In the 1950s, Marion Perkins was one of Chicago’s foremost sculptors. He participated in nearly one dozen invitational exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1942 to 1957 and received three awards of distinction. His career was capped by the museum’s 1951 purchase of one of his most extraordinary pieces, Man of Sorrows. This sculpture is indeed powerful, but its emotional intensity is not achieved through brute force of carving or any “primitivizing” influence. Rather, it succeeds through its brilliant balance of exaggeration and restraint. Its sheer physical presence is conveyed through the impressive bulk of the marble block—often scavenged from abandoned buildings. The head’s simplified, protruding eyes are shut tight; the pursed lips are both hidden and defined by a short stubby beard; the hair is veined with smoothly carved thorns. Christ’s contained expression of agony is arresting.",1805.0,"Artist

"Abundantia, from The Four Continents and Related Allegories, c. 1680/1700, Lodewijk van Schoor","In this tapestry, part of a Four Continents and Related Allegories set, Abundantia, a female personification of abundance, sits on a horn of plenty overflowing with fruit, surrounded by three female attendants, each representing a continent. The kneeling woman crowned with a circlet of blossoms, offering a basket of flowers and fruit, personifies Asia. The dark-skinned woman bearing a horn of plenty full of sheaves of grain represents Africa. The third attendant, who wears a feathered headdress and displays gold, silver, and pearls, can be identified as America. The attributes of all four figures are based on Cesare Ripa’s Iconologia (1593), and their depiction exemplifies the early style of their designer, Lodewijck van Schoor: they have elongated bodies, small heads, long noses, and broad arms and legs, and though they gesture dramatically, their poses are formulae repeated throughout the set.",1806.0,"Artist

"No. I.Z, 1960, Yayoi Kusama","Yayoi Kusama began making art during childhood as a vehicle for both escape and therapy. At the age of 12, she sketched an elaborate, disturbing portrait of her mother based on hallucinations of repeated, encompassing patterns of dots and colors. These visions would continue to influence her art and appear in her performances, paintings, sculptures, and environments throughout her career. In 1957 Kusama moved from Japan to New York and began her “infinity net” paintings, filling canvases with minimal, meditative compositions of netlike patterns. While these patterns appear to be devoid of an overtly expressive quality, the artist’s labor-intensive technique of mark making reflects her highly emotive intent and obsessive concern with process. She has lived and worked in Japan, at times under unorthodox conditions, since 1973.",1810.0,"Artist

This name also referred to the artists’ group—including Van Doesburg, Piet Mondrian, and Georges Vantongerloo—associated with the publication. These artists saw abstraction as an almost spiritual vehicle to reconstruct art and society following World War I. Their approach, as exemplified by Counter-Composition VIII, was marked by fundamentals: geometry (squares, rectangles, and straight lines) combined with asymmetry; pure primary colors used along with black and white; and positive and negative elements. In addition to painting, De Stijl had a great impact on architecture and design, and it deeply influenced Germany’s famed Bauhaus.",1811.0,"Artist

"Virgin and Child, c. 1520, Jan Gossart","The first Netherlandish painter known to have studied classical sculpture in Rome, Jan Gossart achieved a sophisticated fusion of Renaissance vocabulary and traditional Netherlandish style and form. In this painting, the Virgin’s classicizing draperies and the child’s athletic figure show Gossart’s command of the new Renaissance style. The Virgin presents the Child so that his glance and blessing gesture are directed beyond the picture to the right. This suggests that the panel was once paired with another depicting a donor in prayer, with which it would have formed a portable folding altarpiece. Earlier Netherlandish painters had favored this format of paired, hinged panels, now called a diptych.",1823.0,"Artist

One of Ridolfo’s most celebrated pictures, this work reveals his careful study of the portraits of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael in its calm, pyramidal, and expansive presentation of the sitter and in its active, searching light. The foreground parapet, or ledge, over which a hand projects illusionistically into the viewer’s space and the glimpse of landscape through the window are devices Ridolfo borrowed from Flemish painting.

Skillfully combining the vigorous gestures of Abstract Expressionism with the playful use of found materials and compositions of Dada and Surrealism, the artist took previously cast-off pieces of sheet metal and then crimped, bent, and cut the usually unyielding material into an imposing form.

"Coming Squall (Nahant Beach with a Summer Shower), 1835, Thomas Doughty","As the first American artist to identify himself as a landscape painter, Thomas Doughty was instrumental in pushing the genre beyond mere topographical description to explore the larger idea of nature itself. Produced at the height of his career, this view of the sea at Nahant, Massachusetts, recalls 17th-century Dutch landscapes in the way that it captures changing atmospheric conditions and their effect on the surroundings without any hint of a narrative. Such paintings made Doughty one of the most popular landscapists in the United States in the 1820s and 1830s. In elevating nature as a worthy subject in its own right, Doughty, like fellow artist Thomas Cole, was particularly influential for the generation of landscape painters who came after him, namely the Hudson River School.",1833.0,"Artist

"Woman with Large Breasts and Old Woman, 1908, Suzanne Valadon","Images of women washing themselves are ubiquitous in the history of Western art. The female nude in general has long been considered one of the most important subjects of artistic expression, most importantly in the form of history painting, traditionally represented in classical or biblical subjects. However, in the late 19th century progressive artists spurned traditional history painting in favor of contemporary subject matter—art of the moment that represented real life. The artists featured in this gallery made the theme of the bathing woman thoroughly modern. During this period, public health officials encouraged regular bathing not only for cosmetic reasons, but also as a means to combat diseases such as cholera. As a result, more and more people washed indoors regularly. The images in this gallery by Edgar Degas, Félix Vallotton, Pierre Bonnard, and Suzanne Valadon, for example, show modern accouterments of indoor plumbing—large porcelain tubs and taps for running water. Though these prints and drawings allude to contemporary industrial developments and evolving societal expectations, they remain principally devoid of narrative. They depict anonymous women across a range of social classes, including some models who were probably prostitutes, in the intimate act of washing. These artists used the subject of the bathing woman as an evocative means to an end—especially Degas, who returned to the theme of the bather literally hundreds of times between the late 1870s and his death in 1917. Degas utilized bathers to explore the possibilities of the human form—employing multiple angles and viewpoints, depicting its shape and various movements, and reflecting the many colors and textures of the environment.",1834.0,"Artist
