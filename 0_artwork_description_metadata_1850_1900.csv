"“A” and the Carpenter I, 1973, Sam Gilliam","In the early 1960s Sam Gilliam began to experiment with brushless painting—staining or dying his canvases rather than applying paint more traditionally, a technique associated at the time with Color Field painting. By the end of the decade he broke with tradition in another way, abandoning the taut, stretched canvas of typical easel painting to treat his canvases sculpturally—bunching, folding, or draping them in space. The fluidity of the cloth seems to echo the fluidity of the paint, and vice versa. A quintessential work like “A” and the Carpenter I is a painting on a grand scale and yet, like a stained drop cloth slung across two sawhorses, it summons the residues of an artist’s studio, or even the remainders of another kind of work site.",1852.0,"Artist

"The Baptism of Christ, 1500/05, Perugino","Perugino’s serene and decorous art was widely influential in his native region of Umbria and beyond, most famously through his contact with the young Raphael. These four panels, together with another one depicting the Resurrection, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, once constituted a predella—a series of small pictures, often with narrative content, forming the base of an altarpiece. In this case, the painting that was positioned above the predella as the focal point of the altarpiece is unidentified. The predella scenes depict moments when Christ’s special nature was revealed: his birth, his baptism by Saint John the Baptist in the river Jordan, his conversation with a woman of Samaria at the well of the patriarch Jacob, the Resurrection, and his appearance to Mary Magdalene after the Resurrection.",1854.0,"Artist

"Lovers Surprised by Death, 1510, Hans Burgkmair, the elder","Themes derived from the Dance of Death, a medieval allegory in which Death overcomes people of all ages and levels of society, pervaded German art in the late medieval and Renaissance periods. As the first true chiaroscuro woodcut, Hans Burgkmair’s compelling depiction of lovers torn apart by death is a work of pivotal importance. It represents a major cognitive leap on the part of the artist, who was the first to compose an organic three-dimensional composition by juxtaposing and overprinting three tones added by three different wood blocks.",1858.0,"Artist

"Calla Lilies, 1922/25, Arthur B. Carles","In 1922, Arthur B. Carles began a series of calla lily paintings, using the flowers’ stark shapes as the basis for formal experiments into color and surface. Calla lilies were of particular interest to Carles’s fellow modernists such as Georgia O’Keeffe, Charles Demuth, and Marsden Hartley because of their sexual connotations, which these artists frequently exaggerated or exploited. Carles’s Calla Lilies does not appear to carry any erotic overtones but instead is restrained in color and almost classically composed. Carles played with the effects of light and shadow on the curving shapes of the blossoms, contrasting the firmly modeled white flowers with the more loosely painted background. These juxtapositions expressed his fascination with the play of space in his compositions, and he likened the deliberate intervals between the flowers to the rhythmic qualities of music.",1860.0,"Artist

"Figure, 1927, Pablo Picasso","Head is an example of Pablo Picasso’s constant experimentation with style and technique: to make this work, he laid the canvas flat and sprinkled powdered pigment, in a manner similar to Native American sand painting, onto the still-wet painted surface. In some areas, Picasso left layers of the powdery material undisturbed, making a rough surface; in others, he scraped the pigment off, producing a flat and blurred effect. The experimental qualities of Head certainly appealed to its first owner, English Surrealist artist Gordon Onslow Ford, who asked André Breton to contact him if he found any ""marvelous"" works for sale. Ford enthusiastically purchased this painting after seeing a photograph that Breton sent to him in response to his request.",1863.0,"Artist

"Cygne Crépusculaire (Twilight Swan), 1949, Joseph Cornell","This box is closely related to the earlier, untitled box known as For Tamara Toumanova and is specifically a tribute to the prima ballerina‘s performance in an outdoor product ion of Swan Lake, which Cornell attended. Its spare elegance, the contrast of the simple “rustic” frame with the picturesque intricacy of the wooded landscape, and the various light effect s created by the blue glass and the mirror seem to recreate the experience of open-air ballet. The swan itself fills the foreground and appears at home in its natural setting, but is simultaneously distanced from it by the blue moonlight, its identity with the ballerina indicated only by a brilliant, clear gemstone (a second one is now lost). Cornell has here restricted his incorporation of the delicate and decorative materials associated with the ballerina‘s presence, which elsewhere include feathers and sequins, to this artificial diamond, a conceit in keeping with the paradoxical nature of the event.",1866.0,"Artist

"Dovecote (Colombier), 1950, Joseph Cornell","This work belongs to a series of boxes, often referred to as Dovecotes, whose spare, geometric structure brings them very close to abstraction. In one of the earliest of these, Untitled (Multiple Cubes) of 1946–48 (New York 1980–82, no. 173, ill.), vertical and horizontal slats create a regular, three-dimension al grid, which houses slightly irregular cubes. In several of these Dovecote Boxes, the compartments are rectangular and in some cases contain balls; here, the openings are circular, as in an actual dovecote, or colombier. This kind of birdhouse, often of grand proportions, was used to breed pigeons and had access holes small enough to prevent the entry of predators.",1870.0,"Artist

"Dovecote (Colombier), 1950, Joseph Cornell","Although Cornell frequently used repetition as a formal device, the Dovecote Boxes are unusual in that the repetitions, with sometimes minute variations, constitute both form and image. The boxes with a rectangular grid most closely recall the New York paintings of Piet Mondrian, such as New York City of 1941–42 (Paris, Musée national d’art moderne; see The Hague, Haags Gemeentemuseum, Piet Mondrian, 1872–1944, 1994, exh. cat., no. 164, ilL), with its sense of architectural scale. This Dovecote also recalls the pure forms and white interiors of the International Style. That Cornell was indeed thinking in terms of architecture is confirmed by a diary note of January 2–3, 1950. In it he recorded a particularly fruitful day in New York when he found “Thibault [sic] Perspectives” and a French architectural magazine in the Corner Bookshop: “the whiteness and imagery of the Thibault [sic] supplemented thoughts about working on the bird boxes with their architecture” (Cornell 1993, p. 167). Cornell was presumably referring here to a treatise on perspective by Jean Thomas Thibaut (1757–1826), which was published posthumously in Paris in 1827 as Application de la perspective lineaire aux arts du dessin (the author’s last name is spelled Thibault in this 1827 publication). It was one of a large number of such studies intended for instruction in academies and schools in nineteenth century France.",1870.0,"Artist

"Dovecote (Colombier), 1950, Joseph Cornell","Despite their formal purity, the Dovecote Boxes are rich in associations. For instance, the round holes in Dovecote recall the portholes of the great ocean liners linking New York to Europe, a part of the world with which Cornell had strong spiritual ties, exemplified by his debt to French Romantic and Symbolist poets and to the Surrealists. A work entitled Porthole Cage was indeed included in Cornell’s “Aviary” exhibition of the previous veal at the Egan Gallery, New York (Dec. 1949).",1870.0,"Artist

"Dovecote (Colombier), 1950, Joseph Cornell","As noted in the above media description, there is a small strip of wood resembling a perch below each of the holes in the top foul rows. While this feature tends to reinforce the notion of a birdhouse, the box’s structure also strongly resembles two types of games. First, it has affinities with the generic type to which Forgotten Game also belongs, in which a ball or balls are rolled along channels, or may drop into or out of slots. Secondly, it recalls the ancient Chinese strategy game Go (and the modern Othello), in which black and white pebbles or counters are moved on a board. But in the case of this box, the pattern or necessary order is not given, and one returns to a contemplation of the more abstract relationship between the contrasting white and “black” holes, as in a Constellation by Jean Arp. In spite of the apparently rigid arrangement, there is a strong sense of randomness or, to follow the analogy with Arp, of a type of order so in accessible to the viewer that it is perceived as chance.",1870.0,"Artist

"Dovecote (Colombier), 1950, Joseph Cornell","The interplay between the minimal and the associative recalls works by Marcel Duchamp, such as Why Not Sneeze Rrose Selavy? (1921, Philadelphia Museum of Art; see Pontus Hulten, ed., Marcel Duchamp: Work and Life, Cambridge, Mass., 1993, p. 79, ill.); in the latter, a bird cage is filled with marble cubes resembling sugar lumps in a type of visual pun of which there are certainly echoes here. In a closely related Dovecote by Cornell of 1952 (New York, private collection; sec Waldman 1977, pl. 85), a narrow horizontal space at the base of the box contains three wooden balls that appear to have dropped from the holes above. They inevitably recall eggs at the base of nesting boxes, and remind us that at this time Cornell was fascinated by what he referred to as “Magritte-like puns” (diary entry of May 1950; Cornell 1993, p. 171). He might have had in mind such paintings as Rene Magritte’s Elective Affinities (1933, Paris, private collection; David Sylvester, Magritte: The Silence of the World, New York, 1992, p. 221, ill.), which shows not a bird, but a large egg in side a bird cage. Magritte described this as a “new and astonishing poetic secret, for the shock I experienced was provoked precisely by the affinity between two objects, the cage and the egg, whereas previously I had provoked such shocks by juxtaposing objects without the remotest kinship” (quoted in Sylvester 1992, p. 223). Magritte’s exploration of affinities rather than differences between objects to evoke a sense of the marvelous has parallels with Cornell’s practice.",1870.0,"Artist

"Diego Seated in the Studio, 1950, Alberto Giacometti","After 1925 Alberto Giacometti painted only intermittently, but in the aftermath of World War II, he returned to the canvas. Responding to a visionary experience in which he saw human heads transform into petrified, fixed objects in space, the artist began to make countless portraits from life. Most frequently, he used his wife and, as in this painting, his brother Diego as models. Giacometti was not interested in physiognomic accuracy but used a vortex of lines and a restricted palette to bring forth the abstract essence of his sitters. Often enclosing his subjects within “frames” painted on the canvas, he further isolated these dematerialized, solitary figures, evoking the melancholic existence of the postwar individual.",1871.0,"Artist

"The Hand of Man, 1902, printed 1920/39, Alfred Stieglitz","Alfred Stieglitz worked tirelessly to elevate photography to a medium of art. He edited two journals, Camera Notes and Camera Work; ran a series of galleries where he promoted photography alongside modern painting and sculpture; and made groundbreaking photographs of his own. Stieglitz took this photograph from the back of a moving train as it pulled out of the train yard in Long Island City, New York, and the image was published in the first issue of Camera Work in January 1903. The elegance of the composition belies its rough, industrial subject and emphasizes artistic intent over the technical skills required to make a photograph. The title, too, affirms the artist’s role in a mechanical process of urban transformation.

"The Temptation of the Magdalene, c. 1616/17, Jacob Jordaens","Here an angel supports Saint Mary Magdalene as she ponders whether or not to resist the worldly temptations of gold and jewels offered by an aged procuress. In this early work, Jacob Jordaens had already developed his own rich version of Caraveggesque realism as practiced in Antwerp shortly after 1610 by his older contemporaries Peter Paul Rubens and Abraham Janssens.",1885.0,"Artist

"Virgin and Child, 1240/50","This seated Virgin and Child was carved in the middle of the 13th century, a time when private devotional practices became increasingly popular. In bedchambers or in small oratories, private domestic spaces set aside for prayer, images like this would have served as focal points for prayer and meditation. During the High Middle Ages, the Virgin was revered as a powerful intercessor between humanity and Christ. At the same time, she was also worshipped as the Queen of Heaven. Although the Virgin’s crown has been damaged and the gesture of her right hand is no longer clear, the figure group combines austere majesty and tenderness.",1886.0,"Title

"Portrait of Magdalena of Saxony, Wife of Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg, c. 1529, Lucas Cranach, the Elder","As court painter to the electors of Saxony, Lucas Cranach the Elder developed a simplified portrait style that catered to his patrons’ concern with dynastic continuity and princely status. His portraits of princes present a legible, if not always flattering, rendering of his sitter’s features and richly patterned costumes. The Saxon princess depicted her married in to the Brandenburg branch of the Hohenzollern family, and her descendants became kings of Prussia and then emperors of Germany. A companion portrait of her husband is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.",1887.0,"Artist

"Magnetic Mountain, 1948, Kurt Seligmann","After Kurt Seligmann settled in Paris, his sinister, biomorphic compositions gained the attention of André Breton, who invited him to join the Surrealist group in 1937. With the outbreak of World War II, Seligmann became the first Surrealist to arrive in New York and was instrumental in the emigration of most of the movement’s leading figures. Transformed by contact with new cultures, Seligmann’s work continued to evolve, and as the Surrealists’ acknowledged expert on magic, he infused his paintings with mythology and esotericism. Indeed, the year he made this work, he published The Mirror of Magic, a history of the occult. The winding forms and mystical quality of this canvas would influence a new generation of American artists, including his student, Robert Motherwell.",1893.0,"Artist
