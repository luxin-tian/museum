"Untitled (Match-Woman I), 1920, Francis Picabia","Picabia was at the center of Dada’s more celebrated activities between 1917, the year he brought out the first issue of his irreverent journal 391, and October 1924, when he published the final issue of 391 (no. 19) attacking the new movement of Surrealism. Although he frequently collaborated with the Dadaists, he also occasionally denounced them from the platform of 391, of which he carefully retained control. Le Pilhaou-thibaou, the name given to issue number fifteen of 391 (July 10, 1921), inveighed against Paris Dada, but by the following year, the wounds were healed and Picabia happily collaborated with André Breton and his group on a new series of the journal Littérature, designing many of its most provocative covers (see London, Hayward Gallery, Dada and Surrealism Reviewed, 1978, exh. cat. by Dawn Ades, pp. 161-75). While Marcel Duchamp, beginning in 1912, was the first to explore the symbolicand anti-aesthetic possibilities of the machine and mechanical imagery, it was Picabia who, perhaps more than any other artist, later pursued the theme with magnificent inventiveness. In many ways Picabia represented the public face of Dada, regularly exhibiting at the official salons in Paris, which he taunted through his use of highly unconventional materials, a characteristic exemplified by the Bergman work.",1904.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Match-Woman I), 1920, Francis Picabia","While acknowledging this picture’s indisputable originality, scholars have raised some questions about the accuracy of the date 1920 inscribed at lower right. If correct, this date would place the work several years before any other work of its kind. William Camfield and Charles Stuckey have suggested that Picabia may have mistakeningly added this date well after the painting was completed. It is difficult to date Picabia’s work from the Dada years because he often experimented with radically different styles. This work seems to relate most closely to a group of collages which are dated roughly between 1923 and 1926, and which are composed of such diverse mateials as matches, toothpicks, drinking straws, coins, curlers, combs, hairpins, feathers, curtain rings, noodles, a tape measure, and even shoe soles. As in the Bergman picture, in these works Picabia arranged the collage elements on a simple, flat, painted background, and diverted the objects from their original, utilitarian function to make a coherent, clearly recognizable image.",1904.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Match-Woman I), 1920, Francis Picabia","Several factors, nevertheless, seem to support a date of 1920 for this work. The March 1920 issue of 391 (no. 12) relfects Picabia’s increasing opposition to accepted art forms, an attitude that may well have prompted him to experiment with readymade materials. On thecover of this issue, he reproduced his own version of Duchamp’s Tableau Dada: LHOOQ—an image of Leonardo da Vinici’s Mona Lisa penciled over with a mustache (Picabia forgot the beard; Camfield 1979, pl. 19, between pp. 70 and 71, p. 141 n. 240. In addition, Picabia’s ""Manifeste Dada"" published in the same issue beneath the reproduction of Duchamp’s work, is one of his more aggresive attacks on modern art and its values— above all on Cubism. The following year he would utilize collage materials with a vengeance, culminating in his raucous submissions to the Salon des Indépendents of 1922. These consisted of The Merry Widow, Straw Hat?, and Saint Guy’s Dance, all of 1921. The last two include string, which is also a component of the Bergman collage. Finally, the rough capital letters of the signature and numerals of the date on the Berman work are consistent with those on a group of 1920 portraits of his Dada colleagues and on a self-portrait.",1904.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Match-Woman I), 1920, Francis Picabia","The other version of this work, Match-Woman II, formerly in Breton’s collection and dated 1924/25 can easily be distinguished from the Bergman version by the pendant on the woman’s necklace, signaled by a larger coin. In this second version, the arrangement of matches and white highlights gives the impression of lonfer, more disorderly hair; the figure’s head is also shorter and slightly wider. Most significantly, the face and neck are outlined with thick lines of light blue paint, rather than the string used in the Bergman collage and in workds of the early 1920s, such as the 1921 collage Straw Hat?.",1904.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Match-Woman I), 1920, Francis Picabia","The tipped matchsticks, of which there are three different styles in the Bergman collage, convey with precision the prinked and permed appearance of a fashionable woman of the time. Dada’s relationship with fashion is intriguing and unexpectantly multifaceted. Breton was strongly influenced by Jacques Vaché, a dandy in the purest sese, while Picabia himself moved simultaneously in the worlds of the fashionable le tout Paris (Parisian high society, which included famous figures from the literacy and artistic worlds) and Dada. Fashion was a major theme of the 1921 ""Salon Dada"" exhibition at the Galerie Montaigne in Paris: an elegant male mannequin, for example, was poised high up on the wall above the installation, with a long row of knotted ties hanging from a balcony below his feet (Washington, D.C., National Museum of American Art, Perpetual Motif: The Art of Man Ray, 1988-90, exh. cat., p. 92, ill.) In 1921 Picabia described the Dadaists, with whom he was then at war, as ripe for Paul Poiret, a fashionable French couturier (Le Pilhaou-thibaou [July 10, 1921], p. 6). The back page of the July 1924 issue of 391 (no. 18, p. 126) featured an enigmatic photograph of a pearl necklace of French coins in the Bergman collage. That particular issue of 391 in fact focused on modern art and fashion: ""Picasso,"" Picabia wrote in one of his typical aphorisms, ""creates modern anxiety in the manner of Paul Poiret"" (p. 125).",1904.0,"Artist

"Salome Asking Herod for the Head of Saint John the Baptist, 1455/60, Giovanni di Paolo","Giovanni di Paolo worked within the conservative artistic tradition of Siena, creating rich patterns and an intensely devotional mood in his paintings. Among his finest narrative works are these six panels, part of a series of twelve depicting the life of Saint John the Baptist, the kinsman and prophet of Christ. Other panels from the series are scattered in European and American collections; they may originally have formed the doors of a shrine housing a relic of the saint. In the first of the Art Institute’s panels, the young Baptist enters the wilderness to live as a hermit; later he foretells Christ’s role as redeemer, is imprisoned, and is finally martyred at the request of Salome, the step-daughter of King Herod.",1905.0,"Artist

"The Coast of Labrador, 1866, William Bradford","William Bradford devoted the bulk of his career to painting Arctic scenes like The Coast of Labrador. Rendered in minute detail and suffused with light, the artist’s Arctic compositions share stylistic motifs with John Frederick Kensett’s Luminist views of the Rhode Island coast. Bradford first traveled to Labrador between 1854 and 1857; it was not until 1861, however, that the region became his main source of inspiration. He returned to Labrador repeatedly over the next eight years. Signed and dated 1866, this painting probably derives from a number of sketches he accumulated during an 1865 journey, and it attests to Bradford’s interest in the diverse light effects and rocky landscape of the Arctic.",1909.0,"Artist

"Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk, 1989, Andrea Fraser","Andrea Fraser is a performance and video artist who has been regarded primarily as a pioneer of ""institutional critique,"" since she structures her work around existing museum practices and protocols such as gallery talks and welcome speeches. Although they often begin rationally, her performances progressively unravel, frequently devolving into discussion of eccentric topics or performances of taboo behaviors. Spanning more than a decade, the five works in the Art Institute’s collection are among Fraser’s earliest and most influential creations.
Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk documents Fraser’s use of an invented persona—a formally attired, uptight docent named Jane Castleton—to present a social history of the art museum that focuses, as one scholar described it, on the ""relationships between class and taste, private philanthropy and public policy.""[1] The work was the first of its kind and remains a landmark in the recent history of performance art.",1920.0,"Artist

"Strange Worlds, 1928, Todros Geller","In Strange Worlds, the Ukrainian-born Jewish artist Todros Geller reflected on the complex blending of old world traditions and modern culture that characterized Chicago—what he termed the collision of many “strange worlds.” The painting depicts a traditionally dressed Jewish man staring guardedly out at the viewer from beneath the diagonal steel stairway of a Chicago “L” station. In the background, pedestrians and vehicles stream past, rendered by Geller in a swirling, modernist array of circles. The angular planes that fracture the space of the painting further reveal Geller’s interest in modern pictorial construction. Yet the old world vendor stands immobile, isolated from the fast-paced city that swirls around him, suggesting his resistance to modernity and change. This subject was of great significance to Geller, who also illustrated a sociological study focused on the challenges of assimilation faced by Chicago’s Jewish community.",1921.0,"Artist

Turned off toward Bayside-was strongly reminded in the autumnal evening of former vacations in country” (Cornell 1993, p. 132). The fungi mentioned here may have included the ones incorporated into this box. These finds of country flotsam were powerfully evocative of Cornell’s childhood, of a lost American countryside, and an even more distant, imagined past. Pounding his grasses, he thought of himself working like an herbalist or apothecary of old with these sweet scents in my own fashion “ (Cornell 1993, p. 117).",1922.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Large Owl), c. 1948, Joseph Cornell","The owls themselves in the two Bergman examples are ingeniously constructed of ready-made, paper illustrations, which are pasted onto half-inch thick, flat pieces of wood, cut out to form the silhouette of an owl. In the case of Large Owl, as mentioned in the media description, two yellow plastic eyes with brown centers are glued to the image. In the later Lighted Owl, a large plastic spider rests on the tip of the piece of bark on which the owl is perched. Such devices clearly point up the ambiguity of what Cornell called his “Natural History” habitats, where the clash between the natural elements, such as bark and moss, and the modern, manufactured materials posits their artificiality and makes very explicit the distance between Cornell‘s boxes and the dioramas of a natural history museum with their “real” stuffed birds, of which he undoubtedly knew (see Ades, in New York 1980–82, p. 38).",1922.0,"Artist

The owl is Minerva’s bird, and also that of the alchemists, not too distant cousins of the apothecaries with whom Cornell identified as he prepared his grasses. The owl’s association with death often takes the form of a warning about mortality: the “remember thine end” of the memento mori. One such image, with which Cornell was certainly familiar, a Memento Mori of 1769, exhibited in Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1936-37 (see exh. cat., no. 90, ill.), shows an owl perched on a head that is half skull, half living face, with the trappings of the vanitas theme around it.",1922.0,"Artist

"Violet and Silver - The Deep Sea, 1893, James McNeill Whistler","After years of painting seascapes on a significantly smaller scale, Whistler returned briefly to the large-format canvas to capture the effects of a hot summer day on the coast of Brittany. According to the Chicago collector Arthur Jerome Eddy, the artist painted this seascape while boating off the coast as a crewman steadied their vessel. This could account for the unusually broad handling of paint and thick touches of pigment apparent throughout the composition, particularly in the clouds and gently cresting waves. Even toward the end of his life, Whistler demonstrated his enduring passion for the myriad relationships of color offered by the ever-changing sea.",1923.0,"Artist

"Amphora (Storage Jar), about 455/445 BC, Ancient Greek","This vase has a distinctive shape characterized by an elongated ovoid body on a thick disk foot, an offset flaring neck, an inverted lip with grooves for a lid, and handles that rise from the shoulder and curve below the height of the mouth to join the neck. The type is called a Nolan amphora, after Nola, Italy, the site where the first examples of this shape were discovered and where this example was also found. It probably contained wine, olives, or oil. Nolan amphorae are small, usually less than fifteen inches high. Figures are drawn between the handles on the front and back. Below, a length of meander pattern provides a ground line.",1925.0,"Culture

"And a Special Fear for My Loved Ones, from The Black Woman [formerly The Negro Woman] (published 1946-47), 1947, printed 1989, Elizabeth Catlett","The I Am the Black Woman series (previously called Negro Women) is composed of 15 linocuts accompanied by explanatory titles and texts. The series celebrates the courage and determination of female heroines of African American history, as well as the valor, integrity, and resolve of ordinary women. The Art Institute’s three prints from the series focus on the daily struggles of African American women. Aesthetically, the entire series is characterized by an emphasis on figural simplicity. A palpable sense of movement and a lack of excessive detail are visible throughout the series. This print, And a Special Fear for My Loved Ones, draws attention to the issue of lynching, an ever-present threat that plagued the African American community in the South.",1929.0,"Artist

"Sun Rays—Paula, Berlin, 1889, printed 1920/39, Alfred Stieglitz","Although Stieglitz made this photograph of his lover Paula early in his career, he did not exhibit or publish it until 1921 at the earliest; shown frequently thereafter, it became one of his best-known works. In contrast to the more atmospheric, seemingly timeless images he was making at the time, such as The Net Mender, Sun Rays is sharp and crisp, as well as modern in its subject matter—the photographs on the wall include a small studio portrait of Stieglitz himself. Only later in his career, after his conversion to “straight” photography, did Stieglitz recognize the modernist impulses at play in this photograph and connect it to his more recent work.",1931.0,"Artist

"Christ and the Woman of Samaria, 1500/05, Perugino","Perugino’s serene and decorous art was widely influential in his native region of Umbria and beyond, most famously through his contact with the young Raphael. These four panels, together with another one depicting the Resurrection, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, once constituted a predella—a series of small pictures, often with narrative content, forming the base of an altarpiece. In this case, the painting that was positioned above the predella as the focal point of the altarpiece is unidentified. The predella scenes depict moments when Christ’s special nature was revealed: his birth, his baptism by Saint John the Baptist in the river Jordan, his conversation with a woman of Samaria at the well of the patriarch Jacob, the Resurrection, and his appearance to Mary Magdalene after the Resurrection.",1936.0,"Artist

"Breaking Storm, Coast of Maine, 1894, Winslow Homer","Breaking Storm, Coast of Maine is a study of bands of juxtaposed color constructed along a strong horizon line, emphasized by a thick, dark line. Despite Homer’s indication of impending bad weather moving in from the horizon, this watercolor focuses on a moment of calm before the storm. The water’s turquoise surface is smooth and tranquil, achieved by pure, transparent washes. The artist’s loose, abstract handling of the rugged shore in the foreground calls attention to the sheer beauty of his brushstrokes.",1938.0,"Artist

"Breaking Storm, Coast of Maine, 1894, Winslow Homer","Homer conjured the effect of land, sea, and sky seen through a veil of rain and humidity by painting wet-on-wet. In this manner, the artist introduced a new wash into one that is still wet, allowing colors to run and blend without solid boundaries. Evidence indicates that Homer learned the practice from studying Japanese ink paintings and began to employ it extensively beginning in 1889.",1938.0,"Artist

"Calvary, c. 1503–04, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer described this deceptively simple image of Jesus Christ’s Crucifixion as one of his “schlechtes Holzwerk,” his “plain” or “homely woodcuts.” Yet the number of figures represented, the receding landscape, and the pathos embodied by the swooning Virgin Mary and the kneeling Mary Magdalene exceed the artist’s own modest assessment of the work. In comparison with earlier woodcuts, especially the quickly produced book illustrations undertaken in Wolgemut’s workshop, the woodblock must have been cut particularly closely to the artist’s own design. While busier than Dürer’s monumental Passion woodcuts from the same period, this moving woodcut hints at the artist’s past and future.",1941.0,"Artist

"Portrait of a Young Lady, c. 1620, Paulus Moreelse","The youthful subject of this portrait is bedecked in jewelry that features gold, enameling, gems, and pearls. Linked medallions emphasize the puffed contour of her sleeves, but most of her jewelry is intended to call attention to the wide neckline of her dress, framed in luxuriant lace. The delicate forms of the pearl necklace, with its jeweled drops, and the showy brooch backed by ribbons complement the openwork of the lace ruff and collar. Paulus Moreelse, who worked in Utrecht in the prosperous Dutch Republic, specialized in portraiture. The exceptional richness of this unknown woman’s dress suggests that she was port of the court of the House of Orange-Nassau.",1944.0,"Artist

To create this man’s likeness, the artist painted a thin piece of wood with encaustic, or pigmented wax, a medium that not only gave the impression of three-dimensionality but also resisted fading and deterioration in the dry climate of Egypt. These highly individualized and lifelike portraits conveyed the wealth and status of the person depicted through clothing, jewelry, and other embellishments, such as the gold wreath of laurels worn by this man.",1945.0,"Culture
