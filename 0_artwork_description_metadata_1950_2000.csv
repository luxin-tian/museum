"The Nativity, 1507/10, Master of the Historia Friderici et Maximiliani","Once thought to be by the young Albrecht Altdorfer, this painting is instead the work of a painter named after a winged altarpiece in the town of Pulkau, near the Austrian and Moravian border. Though the artist takes his name from the Pulkau altarpiece, he was probably active in Vienna. Like other loosely associated South German and Austrian artists of the early 16th century, who are now grouped together as the Danube School, the Master of Pulkau used exuberant natural forms to give a heightened emotional quality to his work. In this altarpiece wing, the swirling vegetation, excited angels, and oversized Virgin and animals direct the viewer’s attention to the vulnerable Christ Child, who is the focus of adoration.",1951.0,"Artist

"Dark Star, 2003, Glenn Brown","Adopting imagery from a diverse array of artists—including Salvador Dalí, Frank Auerbach, and science fiction illustrator Chris Foss—Glenn Brown’s paintings transform his original sources into works of swirling, brightly colored paint. Copied from reproductions, his distortions project his manipulated figures into an eerily futuristic world. A direct quotation of Rembrandt van Rijn’s A Bust of a Young Woman Smiling (1633; Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden), Dark Star both captures and parodies the subtle expression of the original, yet still mimics its lush surface. Brown’s brushwork is actually thin, even glassy, rendering Rembrandt’s strokes utterly nontactile, their texture an illusion. The title, Dark Star, perhaps quoting the low-budget 1970s astronaut film of the same name, evokes the appeal of the science-fiction genre, serving to transport an Old Master painting into, or perhaps beyond, the realm of kitsch.",1954.0,"Artist

In 1893, the year of the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the 15-year-old Fraser, then a student at the School of the Art Institute, produced the first version of this bronze sculpture. (The Art Institute’s sculpture is a later model and cast.)

Composed of white stone that provides a stark contrast to the colors of the surrounding terrain, the White Place was whittled and smoothed by water and wind over centuries into a striking formation resembling columns, cliffs, and spires. O’Keeffe painted it a number of times, and in The White Place in Sun, she selected a view that emphasizes a deep cleft in the formation.

"An Abundance of Fruit, c. 1860, Severin Roesen","This painting by Severin Roesen, who immigrated to the United States from Cologne in 1848, features a profusion of berries, grapes, peaches, figs, and other fruits piled upon a marble slab. His composition is a celebratory display of nature’s bounty— portrayed in such minute detail as to feel artificial. Roesen worked in Pennsylvania, supported by German immigrants who operated local breweries there. While still lifes in the 19th
century typically adorned domestic dining rooms, Roesen’s painting may have hung in a public tavern or restaurant. For such patrons, the artist probably painted pictures in exchange for beer.

Thompson spent three years (1908–11) studying in Paris, where she began painting in a Fauvist idiom and met her future husband, artist William Zorach. Although the location in this painting is unknown, Thompson might have made the brilliantly hued canvas while traveling back to the United States from Paris; her adventurous seven-month trip took her through Egypt, Palestine, India, Burma, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Korea, and Japan. The wedges of color in the painting suggest the contours of a hill, yet their interlocking forms illustrate Thompson’s desire to create compositions that were “perfectly flat, no planes, distance, perspective, or anything.”",1973.0,"Artist

"Homage to Tamara Toumanova, December 1940, Joseph Cornell","Cornell’s passion for the ballet, illustrated here by this collage and several other works (Untitled (For Tamara Toumanova), Homage to the Romantic Ballet, Cygne Crépusculaire (Twilight Swan), and Untitled (Lighted Dancer)), centered on nineteenth-century Romantic ballet and its contemporary manifestations. Most of his many boxes, collages, and keepsakes connected with ballet are firmly rooted in the traditional imagery of the Romantic ballet, particularly that of its most famous examples: Swan Lake (1877) and Ondine (1869). Cornell’s works would lead us to conclude that he showed little interest in other forms of dance, including the Surrealist ballets Baccanale (1939) and Labyrinth (1941), grand productions of which were mounted at New York’s Metropolitan Opera House with sets and costumes designed by Salvador Dalí (Dalí’s own paranoiac ballet Mad Tristan, with music by Richard Wagner, premiered in 1944). Cornell’s contributions to the journal Dance Index, however, demonstrate that his sensibility did respond to other types of dance, revealing the extraordinary depth of his knowledge of and interest in every aspect of the history of this most ephemeral of art forms.",1979.0,"Artist

"Homage to Tamara Toumanova, December 1940, Joseph Cornell","Ballet had become the rage in the United States during the 1930s, and Lincoln Kirstein, one of the founders of Dance Index in 1942, was one of the first to set up an American-based dance company in 1934, called American Ballet. Cornell not only designed many of the covers of Dance Index, including that of the first issue, a montage of an unusually modernist character entitled Homage to Isadora, he also contributed material from his extensive archives and collections of memorabilia. The great stars of nineteenth-century Romantic ballet—Fanny Cerrito, Fanny Elssler, Carlotta Grisi, and Marie Taglioni—all figure prominently in his work (see, for instance, the cover to “Le Quator danse a Londre,” Dance lndex 3,7–8 [July–Aug. 1944]). Cornell’s interest in these famous ballerinas was profound and in a sense scholarly, but his contributions to the magazine are often even more remarkable for their wide-ranging imaginative connections and revealing biographical anecdote. One interesting issue, compiled and arranged entirely by Cornell, was “Americana Romantic Ballet” (Dance Index 6, 9 [Sept. 1947]). In the space of a brief two-paragraph introduction, he managed references to Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson, and “the hermit of Walden” (Henry Thoreau), before making his special brand of cultural patriotism very clear:",1979.0,"Artist

"Homage to Tamara Toumanova, December 1940, Joseph Cornell","The final sentence expresses Cornell’s own delight in finding “trifles,” the very word so apt to describe the frothy and ephemeral fascination of the Romantic ballet. Knowledge of the ballet was also in some way Cornell’s defense against the image of a culturally barbaric nineteenth-century America, such as that caricatured by Charles Dickens in Martin Chuzzelwit (1844). Although Cornell’s enthusiasm for ballet was arguably part of a widespread fashion, it was as much the history of this art form that exerted its magic over him as it was the living dancers.",1979.0,"Artist

The poet Marian Moore, a friend and correspondent of Cornell’s, who shared his interest in natural history, contributed a defense of the elephant in the form of a review of Balanchine’s Ballet des elephants at the Barnum and Bailey Circus in 1942. In his introductory remarks to this issue, Kirstein aptly described Cornell as “brother to the scientist who recreated a whole pre-historic age from the glimpse of a dinosaur’s tooth.” The fragment whether sequin, feather, face, line of poetry, or briefest anecdote —engendered a world in Cornell’s imagination or in the dreams that were such an intimate part of his working process.",1979.0,"Artist

"Homage to Tamara Toumanova, December 1940, Joseph Cornell","He met Toumanova through Pavel Tchelitehew, a friend and fellow artist on the fringe of Surrealist circles in New York, who designed ballet sets and exchanged gifts with her (sec Dickran Tashjian, Joseph Cornel: Gifs of Desire, Miami Beach. Fla., 1992, p. 111). This collage incorporates a photograph of Toumanova with printed images of butterflies, and sea plants and creatures, evoking both an aerial and underwater world. Cornell thereby suggested that Toumanova is a star who may take her place among the constellations, alongside such mythical figures as Andromeda. The merging of ethereal blue with hints of an underwater environment may also allude to the watery settings of the ballets Swan Lake, Ondine, and Les Sylphides (for a discussion of the conditions between this collage and Cornell’s unpublished scenario for Les Sylphides, see New York 1983, exh. cat. by Sandra Leonard Starr, pp. 6O–61).

It was executed on poplar, a type of wooden support common in Italy, and its elongated format suggests that it was set into paneling as part of a room decoration. The painting celebrates two aristocratic pastimes, jousting and hunting; Scorel used a 1506 woodcut by Lucas Cranach the Elder as the model for the lively crowd watching the joust. Italian patrons were particularly drawn to the Northern European vision of chivalric subjects and courtly pursuits, and the jousting theme was no doubt requested of the young Dutch painter, who showed a talent for combining small active figures in a landscape setting.",1985.0,"Artist

"Half Armor and Targe for Service on Foot, 1590/1600","This is an unusually fine armor with matching targe (shield) for an infantry officer. On the breastplate and pauldrons of this ceremonial parade armor, the etched bands are embellished with interlace, trophies, fabulous beasts, and etched medallions that enclose classical figures reminiscent of Roman heroes. The etched radiating bands retain their original gilded surface, which contrasts effectively with adjacent areas left blackened in the forging process. Armor could be worn with costume accessories to provide a look of great ostentation, which was of paramount importance for public spectacles such as tournaments or parades. Indeed, much of armor’s design and decoration was directly influenced by civilian costume. The breastplate and tassets (steel plates attached to the breastplate) of this half armor, for example, follow the lines of the garments over which they would have been worn.

In 1936 the artist began a series of works on Masonite, which he favored for its raw texture and ability to be worked in ways dramatically different than conventional canvas. Painting demonstrates Miró’s search for new artistic materials, including gravel and sand mixed into oil paint. Fascinated with the effect of these rough substances, the artist told his dealer not to be concerned if any of the materials came loose when he sent the work to an exhibition overseas, since it would ""make the surface … look like an old crumbling wall, which will give great force to the formal expression.""",1988.0,"Artist

Buddhist images made in China but influenced by Tibetan (as well as Nepalese) iconography and style are termed Sino-Tibetan.",1990.0,"Artist

"Female Face Mask (Ndoma), Late 19th/mid–20th century, Baule","Until Côte d’Ivoire’s civil war (2002–2007), Baule village life was regularly punctuated by entertainment masquerades. Such spectacles included masks that were idealized portraits honoring living members of the community. They were attached to a cloth costume and worn by a man—including the female mask displayed here—while the person portrayed typically danced beside him. In addition to individualized traits in its hairstyle and scarifications, this mask’s high forehead symbolizes intelligence and its downcast eyes suggest an introspective disposition.",1991.0,"Culture

"Historians of the Tribe, 1890/99, Frederic Remington","Executed around 1890, the year when the massacre at Wounded Knee effectively ended the army’s conflict with the Plains Indians, Historians of the Tribe clearly situates the glories of Native Americans in the past. In a tightly defined, darkened interior, watched over by a tribal elder in the central background, five men—their postures slumped or languid in surrender—record and reread their hieroglyphic history. At the moment of their defeat, Remington chose to depict his Native American subjects with a certain sentimentality.",1992.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Charles Deering, 1917, John Singer Sargent","Although best known for his portraits, John Singer Sargent was also an accomplished plein air (outdoor) painter. In this uncommissioned likeness of his longtime friend Chicagoan Charles Deering at his home in Florida, the artist harmonized portraiture and landscape, weaving the sitter into a tapestry of swift brushstrokes, warm and cool hues, and the area’s rich vegetation. Dressed in white, Deering relaxes in a cane chair with tropical foliage around him as well as views of boats and blue sky in the distance. Sargent stayed with Deering for two months in 1917 while spending considerable time painting outdoors in both oil and watercolor.",1994.0,"Artist

"Jazz Bowl, c. 1931, Viktor Schreckengost","The Jazz Bowl was originally designed for Eleanor Roosevelt in celebration of her husband Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s re-election as governor of New York, and it has since become an icon of the Jazz Age and an Art Deco masterpiece. Cowan Pottery liked the design, which captures the architecture, music, and nightlife of New York City as Viktor Schreckengost knew it, and the company decided to put the bowl into production. Using Schreckengost’s template and a sgraffito technique, workers scratched the design into the engobe, or black glaze. Schreckengost then inspected and signed the bowl. The final Egyptian blue glaze was applied to reflect New York at night.",1998.0,"Artist

"An Alcove in the Art Students’ League, 1888, Charles Courtney Curran","Charles Courtney Curran documented the atmosphere and activity of the Art Students’ League in New York, where he studied and later taught. Here male and female students practice rendering the idealized human form. Students worked from casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, as well as from reproductions of classically inspired Renaissance objects, such as Michelangelo’s allegorical sculpture Night from the tomb of Giuliano de’Medici, which occupies the lower left corner of this painting. In the 19th century Night would not only have served as an effective demonstration of the art of antiquity but would also have represented one of the more difficult poses to illustrate. Once students mastered drawing antique and antique-inspired sculptures, they would have advanced to a class with live models.",1999.0,"Artist
