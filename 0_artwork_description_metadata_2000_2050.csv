"Untitled, 1968, Donald Judd","An influential practitioner of what would come to be called—much to his chagrin— Minimalism, Donald Judd preferred to describe his often sleek, industrially fabricated works as “specific objects,” neither painting nor sculpture as understood traditionally. His primary form became the box—solid or hollow, enclosed or open—often in exacting, serial arrays. Untitled comprises Judd’s seventh “stack,” a compositional mode that became the signature manifestation of his ideas. Every stack is installed like a spine or column, not only cantilevered out from the wall but also connecting floor to ceiling. Judd sought to banish symbolism from abstraction, intending his work to be experienced physically. This “stack” casts a lush orange glow against the wall around it; as a result, negative space is as much a part of the work as the boxes themselves.",2002.0,"Artist

"Standard Station, 1966, Edward Joseph Ruscha","Standard Station was the first print on which Ruscha collaborated with a publisher, who financed the edition but left the execution up to the artist. Ruscha’s book of photographs Twenty-six Gasoline Stations, specifically the page depicting a Standard Oil station in Amarillo, Texas, provided the model for this print and for a painting he made in 1963. Of particular note is the execution of the graded sky colors. Ruscha achieved this effect through the use of a ""split fountain,"" a technique of blending ink to create a rainbow effect. Originally created for commercial printing (the split fountain had been used in commercial lithographic and screenprinting shops for many years), Ruscha was one of the first to adapt it to fine-art printing. As the art historian Riva Castleman has pointed out, the garish rainbow effect achieved by Ruscha in this print was so often imitated that, by the late 1960s, it had become a printing cliché.",2004.0,"Artist

"Dish, Mid–2nd/early 1st century BC, Ancient Greek","This luminous bowl was made using the laborious and time-consuming composition-cast mosaic glass technique. The particular combination of colors and patterns suggests that this lovely dish was created in the Eastern Mediterranean, a region that grew wealthy from trade with Asian cultures. The town homes and country houses of the local elite boasted beautifully frescoed walls, colorful mosaic floors, and lush, private gardens embellished with decorative sculptures for the sumptuous alfresco banquets that were a favorite evening pastime. This delicate mosaic glass dish was likely made to adorn a splendidly set dinner table alongside other exquisitely wrought platters, bowls, and goblets.",2005.0,"Culture

"The Dwarf, 1937, Georges Rouault","Although Georges Rouault is perhaps best known for his religious imagery, he also painted characters living on the fringes of society. Drawing on the work of such artists as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Edgar Degas, Rouault often depicted circus performers; their tragic-comic essence allowed him to sympathetically comment on the complexities of the human condition. The Dwarf, along with many of Rouault’s other paintings from this period, began as a work on paper that the artist mounted onto canvas during its making and continued to work. This unusual process, in addition to the application of several uneven layers of thick and colorful paint, allowed Rouault to achieve highly expressive effects.",2008.0,"Artist

"Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, modeled c. 1859; carved after 1859, Harriet Hosmer","Harriet Hosmer was the leader of a small group of women who studied sculpture in Rome in the 1850s. Her work frequently addresses the theme of strong, independent women who are ultimately punished for seeking a level of power and ambition thought to be inappropriate to their sex. This portrait depicts Zenobia, the queen of Palmyra, who ruled the Syrian city after her husband, Odenathus, died in A.D. 267. Zenobia conquered Egypt and much of Asia Minor before her defeat by the Roman emperor Aurelian in A.D. 272. Portraying the queen at the moment of her capture, Hosmer emphasized Zenobia’s dignity, remarking, “I have tried to make her too proud to exhibit passion or emotion of any kind; not subdued, though a prisoner; but calm, grand, and strong within herself.”",2009.0,"Artist

"Untitled, September 27, 1981, Keith Haring","This black-and-white drawing consists of broad, linear elements that recall Asian calligraphic characters and pre-Columbian hieroglyphs. The outlines represent two human figures wading in a pool of water and grasping snakes. Keith Haring filled the empty white spaces with black squiggles, embedding the recognizable forms within a field of pattern and movement. Representative of his early work, this drawing exemplifies the artist’s developing language of simplified, archetypal imagery that he derived from ancient and non-European cultures, mass media, and popular culture.",2012.0,"Artist

"The Fifth Knot, c. 1507, Albrecht Dürer","Around 1506, Albrecht Dürer designed a series of six ornate woodcuts of labyrinthine designs after a set of engravings by the school of Leonardo da Vinci, which he may have seen or acquired during an early trip to Italy. Though Dürer left them unsigned, possibly because he borrowed their source material, he referred in his diary to giving away his series of knots on a trip to the Netherlands, and this title has become standard. These impressions are printed on a thin, nearly translucent Italian paper, which may have influenced scholars to occasionally interpret them as embroidery patterns.",2022.0,"Artist

"Miko No Inori, 1996, Mariko Mori","Working with a studio of designers and technicians, Mariko Mori uses sophisticated technology to realize ambitious productions in diverse media including video, large-scale photography, and 3-D imaging. Turning to fashion, pop culture, and science fiction as aesthetic templates, she creates high-gloss digital dreamscapes that refer to Buddhist thought and religious iconography while presenting an optimistic vision of a technological future. Melding Eastern and Western forms and mixing transcendental themes with open appeals to visual pleasure, the artist proposes a cultural condition in which aesthetics, spirituality, and technology intermingle.
Miko No Inori, which translates as the Shaman-Girl’s Prayer, is set in a digitally transformed version of Osaka’s international airport, which seems to be at once a vaulted temple and a sleek, futuristic space. As in many of her videos, Mori appears as a cyborg—a fantasy woman, half-machine, half-human—in this instance, dressed in a white, iridescent costume that complements her reflective ice blue eyes. She cradles and caresses a glass sphere while a haunting pop song plays. The figure recalls a fortune-teller with her proverbial crystal ball, but she also invites other interpretations that coexist uneasily: she can be seen as a bodhisattva—a spiritual guide who forgoes nirvana out of compassion for those who suffer—but she also resembles a model promoting a new product, gazing directly at the audience with her glass orb seductively in hand.",2024.0,"Artist

"Sunday Morning, Mayflower Hotel, N.Y., November 28, 1983, David Hockney","David Hockney began making photographs in 1970, temporarily abandoning his primary medium of painting to explore the possibilities of what he called joiners, composite images made with multiple photographic prints. His joiners aim to get “closer to the way that we actually look at things, closer to the truth of experience.” They eschew the single-point perspective of a traditional photograph in favor of an image containing an accumulation of individual perspectives. Depicting the artist in bed—in the act of taking his own image in the facing mirror, surrounded by newspapers and brochures, cigarettes, and the furnishings of his hotel room—this self-portrait shows his morning as a duration instead of a single moment in time.",2027.0,"Artist

"Black and tanned your whipped wind of change howled low blowing itself-ha-smack into the middle of Ellington’s orchestra Billie heard it too and cried strange fruit tears, 1995, Carrie Mae Weems","Carrie Mae Weems pairs photography and text to make incisive comments on race, gender, and the politics of representation. This photograph is part of a project that responds to 19th-century photographic representations of African Americans. For the series, Weems overlaid appropriated photographs of Africans and African Americans with etched texts that lament physical and symbolic violence to the black body throughout history. This photograph’s 1863 source image, depicting an escaped slave named Gordon, was titled The Scourged Back and widely circulated by abolitionists as antislavery propaganda. The text folds the history of subjugation under slavery onto the history of jazz, nodding to Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday, and the latter’s song “Strange Fruit,” a haunting requiem to victims of lynching in the American South.",2029.0,"Artist

"Merrymakers in an Inn, 1674, Adriaen van Ostade","Over the course of a long and successful career, Adriaen van Ostade specialized in peasant subjects, his treatment of this theme mirroring the general evolution of Dutch painting in the 17th century. In his earlier works, he took a satirical approach to his subject, using a monochrome tonality and visible brushstrokes. The clear, relatively bright colors and fine brushwork of this late painting are in keeping with the refined taste of the later 17th century. Similarly, the rustic figures depicted here, while vividly characterized, are quite decorous in their enjoyment of village pleasures.",2031.0,"Artist

"Autumn, c. 1914, Wilson Henry Irvine","Wilson Henry Irvine first made his artistic reputation in Chicago—he spent his student years at the School of the Art Institute and had a successful career in the city as both a fine and commercial artist. However, although he maintained lasting connections to Chicago, he moved permanently to Connecticut in 1918, having commenced yearly visits to the artists’ colony at Old Lyme as early as 1914. For many American Impressionists, New England towns held great appeal as a source of comfort and nostalgia. Autumn evokes an unchanging landscape, in which the rural traditions of American settlers—from the hand-built walls and and fences to the irregular piles of cornstalks—resonate as reminders of the nation’s past at a time when the country was undergoing tremendous change.",2039.0,"Artist

"For to Be a Farmer’s Boy, 1887, Winslow Homer","For to Be a Farmer’s Boy was painted at Prout’s Neck, Maine, and is one of several watercolors in which Homer returned to his earlier theme of rural American childhood. Although the sky has faded and appears empty, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and FTIR analyses have yielded evidence that the artist originally painted the sky with dilute washes of chrome yellow and pink madder (both fugitive pigments), with a minute amount of vermilion, to create a glowing orange sunset. Thus, the watercolor originally showed a young boy pausing in his work of harvesting pumpkins to gaze off toward the setting sun, recalling the work of French Barbizon School artists, who influenced Homer in his early career. Their pictures of peasants pausing for a moment of contemplation at the end of their workday resonated with Homer, who showed a lifelong preference for depicting workers.",2043.0,"Artist
