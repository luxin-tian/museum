"Landscape No. 3, Cash Entry Mines, New Mexico, 1920, Marsden Hartley","After spending 18 months in New Mexico, Marsden Hartley returned to New York in 1919, but he continued
to paint the Southwest from memory, concluding that true American color existed only in autumnal New England and arid New Mexico. In Landscape No. 3, Cash Entry Mines, New Mexico, soaring mountains tower over mines, minimizing the industrial fate of the landscape. Drawing on the thinking of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and the Hudson River School painters, Hartley hoped that nature would overwhelm and control industry, rather than the reverse. Alfred Stieglitz exhibited this painting in his gallery An American Place.",2053.0,"Artist

"Abstract Figure, 1921/23, Oskar Schlemmer","Established in 1919, the Bauhaus was Germany’s state-sponsored school of art, architecture, and design. Attempting to dissolve the distinction between “fine” and “applied” arts, the school aimed to effect social change after the destruction and devastation of World War I. Oskar Schlemmer was among the first teachers at the Bauhaus, and in his time there he taught classes in life drawing and mural painting and directed the theater and sculpture workshops. Abstract Figure represents the streamlined, modular body of the postwar, regenerated New Man, which was called for by many in German society and celebrated by the artist in the dance performances he choreographed during his time at the Bauhaus.",2055.0,"Artist

"Cyclops, 1947, William Baziotes","Profoundly affected by his encounters with Surrealists who were living in New York City in the 1940s, such as Matta, William Baziotes explored his imagination and incorporated automatism, or automatic drawing, and biomorphic imagery into his art practice. Part of a small group of single-image paintings, this work depicts a combination of a rhinoceros and the mythical one-eyed Cyclops. Inspired by an encounter that the artist had with his favorite animal at the zoo, the artist explained: “I had some peanuts, and as I gave them to the rhino, he sucked my hand and held it. My wife got scared but I was terribly interested. He was playful and cute and toylike, but at the same time he chilled me. He seemed prehistoric and his eyes were cold and deadly.” This work was denounced as “unintelligible” by mainstream critics, but it was awarded a prize in a juried exhibition of abstract and Surrealist American art held at the Art Institute in 1947–48.",2056.0,"Artist

"Icing, 1996, Jeanne Dunning","Since the late 1980s, Chicago-based artist Jeanne Dunning has become known internationally for her provocative photographs and videos that employ the human body to explore gender norms, sexuality, and our visual apprehension of reality. In many of her works, she initially fosters moments of misrecognition, leading us to think that we are looking at something other than what is actually represented. The artist also often develops a degree of tension between the grotesque on the one hand and the sensual or erotic on the other.
In the video Icing, the hands of an anonymous, off-screen woman are shown as she prepares a bowl of white cake frosting. Slowly, over the course of thirty minutes, she uses it to cover the head of another woman, as if decorating a cake. This cool, methodical process depersonalizes the seated woman, gradually obscuring her features. In the end, the sitter loses her individual identity, becoming instead an inert sculptural form vaguely reminiscent of a marble bust, which is accentuated by a white paper collar around the neck that effectively serves as its base. Meanwhile, the actions of the faceless pastry chef resemble the strokes of a brush or palette knife, evoking the act of painting.
Notably, these allusions to classical art forms emerge through activities and materials that traditionally carry feminine, household associations, which are underscored at the end of the video as the woman washes her utensils. In this regard, Dunning’s work recalls feminist video art of the 1970s, which depicted homely activities with a sustained, concentrated focus, aiming to legitimize the place of the domestic in art. The nature of the interaction in Icing complicates this kind of practice, however, by suggesting that a fixation on supposed women’s routines can be potentially restrictive or fetishizing—not unequivocally liberating.",2060.0,"Artist

"Foot of a Cista (Storage Box), early 5th century BC, Ancient Etruscan","With locally abundant sources of copper and modest amounts of tin, Etruscan metalsmiths excelled in fashioning a variety of beautiful bronze objects, including lamp stands, incense burners, mirrors, vessels, and containers. This remarkable object was one of three identical feet supporting a cista, or lidded chest, typically used by women to store their cosmetics and toiletries. The body of the chest was fashioned from a sheet of hammered bronze, and it was probably incised with intricate illustrations of mythological or other scenes. That part is now lost; only the solid-cast feet that once supported it survive. Its now-missing lid likely had an equally exquisite figural handle that would also have been solid cast.",2061.0,"Culture

"The Infants Christ and Saint John the Baptist Embracing, 1520/25, Joos van Cleve","As a center for Europe’s luxury trade in the early 16th century, Antwerp’s markets attracted artists from neighboring regions. There Joos van Cleve found an international clientele and learned to adapt the ideal forms of the Italian Renaissance to a northern European context. In this painting, the poses and modeling of the intertwined children derive from Leonardo da Vinci, but Joos placed the figures in the flamboyant architecture that characterized the Renaissance in northern Europe. The many surviving version of this composition attest to its popularity. This one is unique because it includes the arms of its first owner.

"Crucifix, 1230/40, Master of the Bigallo Crucifix","In late-medieval Italian churches, a monumental crucifix was often attached to the top of a major altarpiece or placed above the rood screen that separated the public nave from the church sanctuary. In either location, it was a focal point of public worship. The painter of this outstanding example was a leading Florentine artist of the middle of the 13th century, named after another painted crucifix in the Museo del Bigallo, Florence. Although his style retains the traditional linear patterning associated with Byzantine models, he employed a new, more natural system of lighting. Also traditional are the smaller figures amplifying the Passion narrative—the Virgin and John the Evangelist flanking the cross, Christ as redeemer above it, and the crowing rooster at its foot referring to Saint Peter’s denial of Christ.",2076.0,"Artist

One new painting type was the independent landscape, an outgrowth of the lovely, naturalistic backgrounds that were one of the most admired aspects of Flemish religious paintings.

"Talo/The House, 2002, Eija-Liisa Ahtila","Like many artists of her generation, Ahtila situates her practice in between film and video, initially shooting on film and transferring to digital video for exhibition. Her works are rooted in her background as a painter, and she employs color, light, and sound in a vivid, surreal way. Talo/The House is a three-channel video installation that envelops viewers, mirroring the protagonist’s acts of self-confinement. The film opens with a woman driving up to a secluded house in the woods. Through a series of fixed camera angles that recall surveillance-camera footage in their passivity and fragmentation, Ahtila describes the interior of the house and its surroundings in vibrant, contrasting colors and lush images. As the film progresses, the protagonist hears voices, her awareness of her environment beginning to disintegrate. She describes her experience to the viewer, stating, “Everything is now simultaneous, here, being. Nothing happens before or after. Things don’t have causes. Things that occur no longer shed light on the past. Time is random and spaces have become overlapping. No place is just one anymore.” As the woman’s perceptions unravel, the images become increasingly dreamlike, eventually creating a complete rupture of spatial and temporal boundaries. In one scene, she floats slowly through the trees outside her home, gently brushing against the branches; in another, her car drives around the walls of her house. At varying intervals, she turns to face the camera, confiding in the viewer directly.",2089.0,"Artist

"Schlesinger and Mayer Store: Circular Medallion from a First Floor Elevator Grille, 1903/04, Louis H. Sullivan","Louis Sullivan’s vision of architecture was largely independent of historical precedent. His philosophy of architecture and ornament was based on a highly individualistic interpretation that saw the perfect building as one whose physical characteristics expressed factors unique to the building such as materials, structures, site, and function. When Sullivan applied this philosophy to the design of architectural ornament, he developed an organic style, which derived its forms from nature and geometry. This circular medallion is composed of a central cross from which four flat shields radiate, employing the sinuous geometry of his previous period as a background against which more fluid shield-shaped and organic motifs are seen.
The Schlesinger and Mayer Store was Sullivan’s last large commercial commission. The department store, known since 1904 as Carson Pirie Scott and Company, attests to Sullivan’s design virtuosity. The facade’s unbroken cellular wall, composed of plate-glass windows in neat rows, rises above two floors of ornamental cast-iron work. Surrounding the street-level windows and encrusting the entrance pavilion at the corner are design motifs derived from geometry and natural forms. Sullivan carried these motifs into the interior, which richly detailed balusters contain stylized seed forms and interlaced ribbons on a background of geometric shapes. The elevator medallion was installed at the hand height on the original cage elevators, which were removed for fire safety reasons.",2095.0,"Artist

"Carnival, 1943, Arshile Gorky","""Those who love easy solutions will find slim pickings here: despite all warnings, they will continue in their attempts to discover still lifes, landscapes, and figurations in these compositions, simply because they do not have the courage to recognize the fact that all human emotions tend to be precipitated in hybird forms. By ""hybird"" I mean to signify the end result produced by the contemplation of a natural spectacle blended with the flux of childhood and other memories provoked by intense concentration upon this spectacle by an observer endowed with quite exceptional emotional gifts. It should, indeed, be emphasized that Gorky is unique among Surrealists painters in remaining in direct contact with nature by standing in front of it in order to paint. He is not concerned, however, with translating nature as an end in itself, but rather with extrating from its sensations capable of acting as springboards towards the deepening, in terms of consciousness as much as of enjoyment, of certain spiritual states.""

"Carnival, 1943, Arshile Gorky","Gorky’s interst in Joan Miró is apparent here, though it would not be easy to pin down specific sources for Carnival. Willem de Kooning recalled that Gorky expressed admiration for Miró’s Still Life with Old Shoe (1937, New York, The Museum of Modern Art; New York, The Museum of Modern Art, Joan Miró. 1993-94, exh. cat. by Carolyn Lanchner, no. 145, ill.), which was shown by Pierre Matisse in the late 1930s (Jordan and Goldwater 1982 p. 75). Like many works by Gorky, Carnival is a composite of memories, experiences, and associations—both personal and artistic—powered by the tension between precisely outlined bud- and bodylike forms, and free, gestural passages. As Diane Waldman has written, Gorky could be described as ""the last Surrealist and the first Abstract Expressionist"" (New York 1981-82, p. 60)",2096.0,"Artist
