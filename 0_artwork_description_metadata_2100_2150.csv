"Pictograph-Symbol, 1942, Adolph Gottlieb","Adolph Gottlieb’s Pictograph series, created between 1941 and 1951, represents the artist’s early efforts at reconciling elements of abstraction with an exploration of the subconscious. To make these works, the artist laid down a grid as an organizing structure. Using a process of free association and intuition influenced by the Surrealist technique of automatism, or automatic drawing, he decided to employ symbols to fill the grid. Mining eclectic source material from non-Western cultures and modern art, Gottlieb invented a pictorial language that aimed to represent and convey universal ideas to the viewer.",2100.0,"Artist

However, an angel bars his way, pointing out the vanity of his procession in comparison to Christ’s humble entry into the city. Only when the emperor dismounted and approached in humility was he allowed to enter, a scene that was no doubt once part of the sequence. Here the emperor is identifiable by the double-headed eagle, which was an emblem of both the Holy Roman emperor of the day and past emperors.",2101.0,"Title

"The Rapids, Hudson River, Adirondacks, 1894, Winslow Homer","By the time Homer first began visiting the Adirondacks in the 1870s, commercial logging operations in the region were beginning to destroy large tracts of forest and to clog the rivers. He acutely observed and recorded these events in his watercolors, rarely passing explicit judgment. In The Rapids, Hudson River, Adirondacks, the artist combined themes of fishing and logging. On first encounter, this watercolor is peaceful and intimate, a virtuoso study of the movement of the river’s surface over partially submerged rocks. Long, painterly strokes of black watercolor over layers of blue describe the depth and speed of the water, while areas of bright white paper have been revealed by scraping to indicate the bubbling froth of whitewater rapids. It is only along the far bank that one becomes aware of the presence of man in this tranquil landscape, implied by the clean-cut logs lying haphazardly along the rocky bank. Even more subtle is Homer’s suggestion of a fisherman’s presence, indicated by the leaping fish at river’s edge, where the artist used his knife blade to sketch the serpentine motion of a fishing line in mid-cast. The fisherman is invisible, yet we are made to understand that the presence of human beings alters nature profoundly.",2107.0,"Artist

"Deer Isle, Maine, probably Movement No. 12—Boats and Pertaining Thereto, 1927, John Marin","In the summer of 1927, Marin commenced a large series of Deer Isle watercolors. Like others in the series, this angular composition features rectilinear subdivisions of forms. A rooflike border at the top unifies the moody sky and harbor. To preserve a sense of lively crispness, the artist used black colored pencil for the preliminary sketch and moderated his use of overlapping painted and drawn lines. He also allowed this sheet to remain more literal and descriptive than other watercolors in the series. Marin may have worn himself out—or exhausted his subject—with this Deer Isle project. He stayed in Stonington for the last time the following year and then spent two summers away from the sea, working near Taos, New Mexico.",2109.0,"Artist

By the late 1960s, the artist began using pointed, single words— chosen as much for their evocative power as for their phonetic qualities—as visual subjects in a variety of media. Between 1966 and 1969, Ruscha made a series of “liquid” or “wet” word paintings, in which the linguistic effect is made more palpable by the trompe l’oeil renderings of the words, which suggest that they have been created from water, oil, syrup, or another fluid.",2117.0,"Artist

"Netting the Fish, 1889, Winslow Homer","An avid angler and sportsman, Homer often depicted fishing and hunting scenes in his artwork. Many of his watercolors that explore these subjects were painted on frequent trips to the Adirondack Mountains. Netting the Fish is unusual in its focus on a gentleman sportsman. Young, well groomed, and neatly attired, the fisherman in this watercolor stands in contrast to the rustic guides featured in many of the artist’s other Adirondacks works. Homer’s fluid brushstrokes describe the smooth surface of the water, and his background washes evoke the wooded shoreline seen at a distance. Netting the Fish is one of Homer’s few grisaille, or monochrome, watercolors, painted as a study of values in preparation for the etching Fly Fishing, Saranac Lake.",2119.0,"Artist

"Study for “William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River”, 1876/77, Thomas Eakins","Best known for his realist portraits and scenes of contemporary life, Thomas Eakins also spent considerable energy on history paintings. Here, he executed a study for a painting that celebrates an early American sculptor, William Rush. In the finished painting, Rush is depicted carving his Water Nymph and Bittern (1809), for which the model poses; the statue adorned a public square in Philadelphia, the hometown of both artists. Eakins, an ardent advocate of studying from life, highlights this artistic working method in his rendering of the female form. In 1870s America, artistic studies from the nude figure remained a rarity, a condition that Eakins worked hard to overturn in the following years as an instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.",2120.0,"Artist

"Mrs. Charles Gifford Dyer (Mary Anthony), 1880, John Singer Sargent","The sitter and her husband, the painter Charles Gifford Dyer, were part of an expatriate community of American artists that lived and worked in Europe in the late 19th century. John Singer Sargent painted this portrait during his first extended stay in Venice as a professional artist. Rather than a formal commission, the work likely served as a souvenir of friendship and shared experiences. Its relatively small scale and the background’s thin, quick brushwork suggest that Sargent completed the canvas in a single sitting. The painting’s dark tones and limited palette are reminiscent of Spanish masters such as Diego Velázquez, whom Sargent looked to in particular during his student years in the late 1870s, and indeed throughout his career.",2121.0,"Artist

"Saint Anthony of Padua, 1485/90, Hans Memling","Hans Memling probably worked with Rogier van der Weyden in Brussels before settling in Bruges in 1465. Van der Weyden was well known for his exquisite devotional diptychs, and Memling was influenced by his work, though he made his paired paintings more realistic by setting the figures in a measurable domestic space. This portrait of the unidentified patron and the image of the Virgin and Child were separated many years ago; they were reunited at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1953. Unfortunately, Portrait of a Man in Prayer is in very poor condition; much better preserved is the image Saint Anthony of Padua, presumably the sitter’s patron saint, on the reverse of the portrait. The saint was painted in subdued tones of gray, in imitation of stone, a convention often used on the backs of Netherlandish altarpieces. Anthony of Padua, an important early follower of Saint Francis, was more popular in Italy, Spain and Portugal than in the Low Countries, hence the diptych may have been made for a member of the large foreign community in Bruges.",2128.0,"Artist

"West Shore Docks, Weehawken, New Jersey, 1910, John Marin","Upon his return to Weekawken in 1910, Marin created a work in which he handled watercolor in the fluid, flooded manner of his Tyrolean landscapes. Like those mountain scenes, this watercolor was constructed in horizontal bands, with an expanse of paper left nearly empty in the middle ground, where the pale stains of wiped, blotted color evoke the dull glare of the river’s surface. This free wet-into-wet application appears in numerous other Weehawken images in which Marin allowed his colors to bleed into each other, giving the scenes of river commerce the soft glow of wintry dawn light. Here Marin’s vantage point high on the riverbank encouraged him to flatten the composition; the shapes of the Weehawken piers extend upward along the picture plane rather than leading the eye into deep space.",2131.0,"Artist

"Icebound, 1909, Willard LeRoy Metcalf","Icebound is part of a series of painings that WIllard Metcalf completed in the artist colony of Cornish, New Hampshire, during repeated visits in the winter months between the years 1909 and 1920. Specializing in landscape, Metcalfe was greatly inspired by Impressionism, yet in this painting, he strayed from the pastel colors of that style and adopted an earthy palette with rich, russet tones. The unconventional look across, rather than along, Blow-Me-Down Brook limits the perspective, forcing the viewer to look down the banks of the brook to the clear, ice-covered water. Painted en plein air in the Cornish wilderness, the winter scenes of this series were some of Metcalf’s most celebrated and critically praised works.",2132.0,"Artist

"War Shirt, 1830/40, Missouri","War Shirts are compelling, quintessential icons of the American West. Perhaps no other chapter in the long history of American Indian art has such high dramatic appeal than that of the 19th century tribes of the Great Plains. With their bison hunts, mounted raids, beaded garments with flying fringes, war dances, and dangerous adventuresome life, these peoples have assumed in our collective imagination a sense of wild yet disciplined freedom. Yet War Shirts also speak of highly ordered, even regimented, societies with their complex systems of obligations, honors, and rewards. These special symbolic garments appeared by the late 18th century, often reflecting ancient beliefs but taking new formal expression. Such works were largely dedicated to acquiring, holding, and controlling supernatural force flowing from plants and animals, the deified natural elements, or legendary culture heroes, and also reflecting the bravery of the wearer. The garments are “additive,” with diverse ornaments, charms, and talismans attached. In the first half of the 19th century such shirts were minimally tailored with partly open seams holding sections of untrimmed hide, including legs hanging down the sides. Strips of bold black and white beadwork recall porcupine quill panels of earlier tribal tradition; ermine tails signaled wealth and authority; and hair fringes were from the owner and his warrior friends as tokens of brothership. Hair from a favorite warhorse might also be added. The quilled medallion symbolizes the circle of the universe, placing the owner and his people in the center of creation. Worn into battle or in triumphal festivals, these long trailing garments invested the wearer with power and a fierce, theatrical panache.

Three years later, Brauner joined the group with the support of Tanguy, and his 1934 solo show at the Galerie Pierre, for which André Breton wrote the catalogue introduction, solidified his position. Like other Surrealists of the period, such as Salvador Dalí and René Magritte, Brauner was inspired by dreams, the unconscious, and mysticism, as well as diverse religions and ancient mythologies. Such influences are present in the artist’s Turning Point of Thirst, one of the works included in his 1934 exhibition.

"Nouveaux Contes de Fées (New Fairy Tales), 1948, Joseph Cornell","The box was designed as a kind of toy to be played with, for the little boxes inside can be rearranged at will. Cornell’s choice of a French publication with which to cover them, together with the images, evokes French novels, which at the time to which the illustrations belong could signify the illicit and the erotic, and were considered unsuitable reading for young ladies. Although this is belied by the title, an aura of the secretive remains. This work is most closely related to Cornell‘s Untitled (Paul and Virginia) of c. 1946–48 (Chicago, Bergman family; see New York 1980-82, pl. IX), which similarly combines engravings and pages of text with mysterious stacks of tiny, closed boxes. In the latter, Cornell used pages from an English edition of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre’s Paul et Virginie (1789) together with engravings that originally accompanied the Curmer edition of 1838. This hugely successful tragic love story of the Romantic era may well have had an additional appeal for Cornell because it was set in the New world. The austere, grid structure of Nouveaux Contes de fees, which is emphasized by the simple, geometric shapes of the boxes and is related to Cornell’s Dovecote series, is in striking contrast to the romantic and rather sugary images.",2145.0,"Artist
