"Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin and Christ Child, c. 1535, Girolamo da Carpi","Girolamo da Carpi was one of the most gifted artists at the court of the Este family of Ferrara, an important artistic center during the Italian Renaissance. This intimate work was painted for the Estes and adorned the oratory chapel of their palace. In the painting, Saint Luke draws the Virgin and Child while Saint Joseph watches unobtrusively from a doorway. As in many Renaissance works, Christ appears agitated—seemingly possessing foreknowledge of his death. He may be reacting to the spearlike yarnwinder, an attribute of the Three Fates and, consequently, a traditional symbol of death.",2152.0,"Artist

"Virgin and Child with the Young Saint John the Baptist, 1527/30 or later, Agnolo Bronzino","This charming image of the Virgin and Child provides a revealing glimpse of workshop practice in the circle of Agnolo Bronzino and his master, Jacopo da Pontormo, two of the most sophisticated Mannerist artists working in Florence. Two other versions of the composition are known; like this one, they are unfinished, though Bronzino brought them to a further state of completion. The most finished example, in a private collection, shows the polished style of Bronzino at the time when he was working under the guidance of Pontormo (and was probably still in his shop). The other two follow a cartoon, or pattern drawing, based on this work and may be from a later date. It is unclear why these replicas were begun and then abandoned.",2157.0,"Artist

"Les Fruits D’Afrique (The Fruits of Africa), c. 1920, Raoul Dufy","Dufy was a painter associated in the early part of his career with the Fauves (""wild beasts""), known for their bold colors and sweeping brushstrokes. In 1909 he met the couturier Paul Poiret, who encouraged his textile work. Dufy established a textile production workshop, which Poiret supported financially, but it closed when Dufy was hired in 1912 to design textiles for the Lyons firm of Bianchini-Férier. Dufy and Poiret remained friends and collaborated throughout their relationship. For the most part, Dufy’s textiles reflect either his brightly colored paintings or his fondness for woodcuts, as seen here.",2158.0,"Artist

"Laughing Mannequins (Maniquís riendo), 1930, Manuel Alvarez-Bravo","In April 1935, New York gallerist Julien Levy included this photograph in the exhibition Documentary and Anti-Graphic Photographs, which brought the work of Manuel Alvarez Bravo together with that of Walker Evans and Henri Cartier-Bresson. For Levy, the “anti-graphic” photograph renounced conventional fine-art qualities—rich tonality, sharp focus, and clear description—to achieve something that was “dynamic, startling, and inimitable.” Alvarez Bravo’s photograph of cardboard mannequins at an open-air market in Mexico City exemplifies this ideal by evoking seemingly unpremeditated associations within a mundane setting. The imagination, stimulated by such a sight, is liberated through what the Surrealist André Breton called “objective chance.” As the title of this work suggests, a reversal of potentialities operates here: the stall keepers and their customers are listless and uninterested, whereas the inanimate cardboard women floating in the air engage the viewer with vivacious smiles and alluring gazes.",2159.0,"Artist

"Art Make-Up, 1967/68, Bruce Nauman","Bruce Nauman’s influential work explores the poetics of boredom, entrapment, and failure. Many of his important early works, such as Art Make-Up, grew out of his involvement with experimental film and video in the 1960s, in which the artist often used his own body as the vehicle for exploration. Here Nauman applied colored makeup—white, pink, green, and finally black—in successive layers to his face and torso. Art Make-Up introduces the themes of surveillance and masking that recur in the artist’s later work. His entire oeuvre can be read as a self-conscious investigation into the conditions and possibilities of art making.",2161.0,"Artist

"Stela of Amenemhat and Yatu, Middle Kingdom, late Dynasty 12–early Dynasty 13 (about 1870–1770 BC), Ancient Egyptian","This stela, or decorated stone monument, depicts a man named Amenemhat seated across from his mother Yatu. A table covered in offerings including bread, meat, and drinks separates them. Amenemhat is portrayed holding a flywhisk, a sign of authority. A blue stone jar designed to hold kohl (eye paint) with an applicator sticking out of its top is shown under his chair. An ointment container is depicted beneath the chair of Yatu, who holds a lotus blossom to her nose. In ancient Egypt, the lotus was a symbol of rebirth. The hieroglyphic text above the figures includes a prayer to the god of the underworld, Osiris: “May he give invocation offerings of bread, beer, oxen, fowl, alabaster, clothing, and every good and pure thing upon which [a god] lives, to the ka (soul) of the retainer Amenemhat, deceased.”",2162.0,"Culture

"The Last of New England—The Beginning of New Mexico, 1918/19, Marsden Hartley","In 1918 Marsden Hartley went to New Mexico in search of an appropriate subject for an authentic American modern art. In the artist’s 18 months there, the Southwest inspired him to reengage with nature and more realistic representational modes. Hartley described the scenery to his dealer, Alfred Stieglitz: “I like the country very well for it is big and clean and true, and there is nothing dirty standing between one and the sunlight, as there is in the east.” In The Last of New England—The Beginning of New Mexico, Hartley celebrated leaving the exhausted East for the unspoiled landscape of the Southwest, which he felt offered weary Americans an opportunity for rejuvenation in nature.",2167.0,"Artist

"Street Scene, 1910, John Marin","Looking west down Wall Street, Trinity Church’s purple facade and spire appear beyond the columned Federal Hall. Marin made these landmarks identifiable, adding color over his graphite sketch with broad but carefully applied strokes. He used a heavy blue pigment that settled into the low points of the paper’s surface and lightly blotted the wet blue wash at upper left, removing just enough color from the high points to accentuate the grainy pattern left behind. At lower left, he used more water, rewetting and then blotting his colors to approximate the obliterating effect of steam emanating from street vents. Using a soft, dark pencil, he outlined the structures and delineated architectural details, adding heads and shoulders to blue dabs of wash to transform them into figures.",2168.0,"Artist

"Working Model for UNESCO Reclining Figure, 1957, Henry Spencer Moore","In the 1950s, Henry Moore executed a number of important public commissions, including Reclining Figure for the headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization in Paris. The Art Institute’s sculpture is one of six smaller bronze versions of the unique, over-16-foot-long marble figure that Moore installed at UNESCO in 1958. The artist looked to many cultures—particularly to enduring examples of art from ancient Greece and the Yucatán region of Mexico—to give his figural works their monumental forms and profound resonance with the art of the past. This reclining figure connects not only to history but also to the earth—its swelling masses and rounded voids suggest the female form as well as a landscape of valleys, mountains, and caves.",2174.0,"Artist

"Detective, 1972–73, Christian Boltanski","Christian Boltanski is a self-taught French artist who first came to critical notice in the late 1960s through his short, avant-garde films that combined real and fictional evidence of his and other people’s lives. In the 1970s, Boltanski began using photography to explore memory and consciousness, often by creating assemblages of documentary photography removed from its original context. The artist wrote of Detective:
I cut the images from a specialized review of crime stories. The photographs—which are similar to those in our own photo albums—are as if from a play, and the people we see in them are the actors, assassins or victims. But it is impossible to differentiate among them, now that the images have been isolated from their context.",2179.0,"Artist

"Landscape of the Four Seasons, About 1560, Sesson Shukei","The artist Sesson Shukei was a Zen Buddhist monk-painter who achieved his idiosyncratic painterly style during an itinerant career in eastern Japan, seemingly without traveling to Kyoto, Japan’s cultural and political capital at the time. His Landscape of the Four Seasons is the only work in the exhibition from the 16th century. Sesson’s dreamlike Chinese landscape expands before our eyes in understandable spatial depth, an effect that is enhanced by the folds of the screen. We read the composition like the Japanese language, from right to left, and follow the flow of the seasons from the first red plum blossoms of the year, all the way across to the snow-covered mountains on the far left. A mountain temple on the right and a village on the left enclose an inlet upon which boats come and go. People bustle about in activity, geologically impossible rock formations twist and turn, and water splashes out from the bottom of a waterfall like reaching fingers.",2183.0,"Artist

Emanuel de Witte was one of a small group of painters who specialized in church interiors. Before he moved to Amsterdam in about 1652, he worked in Delft, a city whose artists were particularly fascinated by light and perspective. In this late painting, somewhat loosely based on one of the chief churches of Delft, the angles of the nave and transept converge on the preacher high in his pulpit; an organ and genealogical panels memorializing the dead provide the only decoration.",2195.0,"Artist
