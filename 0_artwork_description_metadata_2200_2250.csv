"The Mill Pond, 1889, George Inness","A distinctive landscape painter of the 19th century, George Inness excelled at capturing the poetics and mood of his environs, finding spiritual resonances in nature, from its grand vistas to its quiet nooks. The Mill Pond depicts a sylvan setting, in which a small figure rows a boat in the pond at middle distance. Brilliant pigments of orange, green, and blue electrify an otherwise tranquil scene. Through color and atmosphere rather than line or detail, Inness communicated an intensity of vision, fueled by an individual encounter with nature.",2208.0,"Artist

"Splitting, 1974, Gordon Matta-Clark","Gordon Matta-Clark is best known for bold, unconventional drawings, films, photographs, and sculptures relating to the built environment. The son of Surrealist painter Roberto Matta, he studied architecture at Cornell University from 1962 to 1968; there, he met sculptor Robert Smithson, whose interests in land art and the theory of entropy influenced him significantly. After completing his studies, he moved to New York and became a well-known figure among artists in the burgeoning avant-garde scene centered in Soho. Matta-Clark’s principal contribution was as a radical sculptor: he is recognized for his series of “building cuts” (1972–78), in which he carved out sections of entire structures, treating them as spatial compositions. Calling these transformations “Anarchitecture,” the artist documented them in films and photographs that were subsequently exhibited in galleries, often alongside fragments of the buildings themselves.
One of his most celebrated sculptures consisted of a vertical slice into an old frame house located in Englewood, New Jersey. The home, owned by New York art dealer Holly Solomon, was slated for demolition. The resulting film is composed of intentionally artless footage showing Matta-Clark and his friends making two parallel cuts down the center of the house; jacking up one half of the structure and beveling the cinderblock supporting it; and then lowering that half back down, bisecting the home and creating an ephemeral display of light inside the once-compartmentalized interior. The movie’s documentary style is the result of the artist’s dramatically physical approach to filmmaking. It reveals Matta-Clark as a daredevil, climbing around a structure that has nothing but a few jacks preventing it from collapse. The sequences, which study the light effects produced by the building cut, reveal a domestic space transformed into a sundial on a grand scale.
After he created Splitting, Matta-Clark invited select members of the art com-munity to travel by bus to the home and see it firsthand, an act that was not without some physical risk to the out-of-place gallery-goers. Three months later, the house was leveled. While the majority of the artist’s projects were only meant to exist temporarily, films such as Splitting preserve the ephemeral nature of his approach and also remain as important works of art in their own right. Indeed, Splitting has been remembered as “one of the premier moments of a period in which anarchistic, architecturally oriented sculpture coexisted with Conceptual art.” During his short career––he died of cancer at age thirty-five—Matta-Clark made over twenty films documenting his architectural explorations and interventions; these have become an extremely important influence for contemporary artists such as Matthew Barney, Pierre Huyghe, and Rachel Whiteread.",2212.0,"Artist

"Abigail Inskeep Bradford, 1803/8, Rembrandt Peale","Painted sometime after Rembrandt Peale’s 1803 return from London and before his 1808 trip to Paris, this sensitively rendered portrait marks a concerted effort by Peale to expand his repertory to include female subjects. Abigail Inskeep Bradford belonged to a prestigious Philadelphia family; her father served as the city’s mayor (1800–01 and 1805–06) and her brother, John Inskeep, presided over a successful publishing business. Unlike Peale’s portrait of her husband, Samuel Fisher Bradford, in this work Abigail looks away from the viewer, avoiding a direct gaze. This subtle positioning followed social convention of the time, which demanded women be discreet in public and maintain distance from mundane worldly concerns.",2217.0,"Artist

"Blue Tilt, 2004, Jenny Holzer","Since the 1970s, Jenny Holzer has used language as her medium of choice to communicate penetrating ideas about life and death, sex, power, and war. Like contemporaries including Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine, and Cindy Sherman, she appropriates mass media and advertising strategies in her work. Holzer rose to prominence with her Truisms series (1977–79), which consisted of nearly three hundred aphorisms and slogans that play on commonly held truths and clichés such as “A lot of professionals are crackpots” and “A man can’t know what it is like to be a mother.” Displayed as anonymous broadsides on buildings, fences, and walls throughout Manhattan, these statements were meant to provoke public debate. In her more recent work, Holzer continues to use language and current modes of communication to assail established ideas about art’s place, audience, and meaning in modern society. Her texts have appeared on benches, billboards, Internet sites, posters, sarcophagi, in the form of monumental Xenon projections, and, most commonly, as LED (light-emitting diode) signs.
Blue Tilt features texts from five of Holzer’s iconic series: Truisms; Inflammatory Essays (1979–82), one hundred words in twenty lines inspired by the literature of Emma Goldman, Rosa Luxembourg, Lenin, Mao, and others, also printed on posters; Living (1980–82), matter-of-fact writings on “everyday life with a twist” that were originally shown on cast-bronze plaques and hand-lettered metal signs; the urgent Survival (1983–85), which appeared on the Spectacolor board in New York’s Times Square and was the first series the artist conceived for electronic signs; and the desperate Under A Rock (1986), which was engraved on stone benches shortly after Holzer’s move to the countryside of upstate New York. Although all of these texts are the artist’s invention, they do not necessarily reflect her personal views. Indeed, they employ a variety of contradictory voices, assuming a tone of anonymous authority in order to express a wide spectrum of biases and beliefs in which truth is relative. Blue Tilt captures each of these signature moments in the medium most readily associated with Holzer—the LED.
The structure of Blue Tilt’s installation is architectural and dramatic, with imposing sixteen-foot, double-sided signs towering over viewers and bathing the entire space in the light of a relentless stream of words. “One reason I’ve stayed with LEDs so long,” remarked Holzer, “is that part of the experience is that the light and words hit the body. This might give you vertigo; it might represent that there’s always too much information and ‘how do I process it?’ It could make you unsure of the floor; I try to use reflections to that end.” Under her control, the gallery becomes a stage that at once creates and serves an audience that can no longer make itself comfortable.",2230.0,"Artist

Based on a Polaroid, the monumental screenprint is the result of a meticulous and complex technical process, consisting of seven stages and thirteen proofs. The two smaller woodcuts, also on view-composed of dots, dashes, and abstract shapes-closely mirror the artist’s characteristic painting process, exemplified by his larger painting of Alex Katz in the museum’s permanent collection.

"Saint Augustine’s Vision of Saints Jerome and John the Baptist, 1476, Matteo di Giovanni","A leading Sienese painter of the late 15th century, Matteo di Giovanni knew how to combine the poetry characteristic of Sienese painting with the rationalization of space introduced in nearby Florence. This panel, a Crucifixion scene, and the Art Institute’s The Dream of Saint Jerome were part of the base, or predella, of an altarpiece made for the funerary chapel of the Placidi family of Siena; it reflects the family’s devotion to Saint Jerome. Here, as Saint Augustine sits in his study composing a eulogy celebrating Jerome’s life, the saint appears to him in a vision accompanied by Saint John the Baptist. The Baptist tells Augustine that Jerome is to be honored as his equal. Above the narrative scenes on the predella, the center of the altarpiece, which remains in the church of San Domenico, Siena, also had a visionary subject: the Virgin and Child surrounded by angels appearing to Saints Jerome and John the Baptist.",2238.0,"Artist

"Bacchus Consoling Ariadne, c. 1892, Aimé-Jules Dalou","Aimé-Jules Dalou was a protégé of the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and spent his early years studying the art of the 18th century. His first success came with images of modern life, such as nursing mothers and infants, but he later undertook allegorical subjects and historical statues for public commissions in France’s Third Republic. His sculpture Bacchus Consoling Ariadne revisits the small-scale world of Clodion’s mythological terracottas; the plaster was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1892, and a marble based on it (now in the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts) was commissioned by a family named Drapé in Agen, France.",2244.0,"Artist
