"Canopic Jar of the Overseer of the Builders of Amun, Amenhotep, New Kingdom, Dynasty 18, reign of Amenhotep II (about 1427–1400 BC), Ancient Egyptian","During the mummification process, the liver, lungs, stomach, and intestines were removed from the body, separately mummified, and stored in the tomb in four vessels, called Canopic jars. Each organ was placed under the protection of a deity whose head often appears on the stopper of each jar, however the head on this jar depicts the deceased man, named Amunhotep, for whom it was made. Amunhotep held an important civil job as an overseer of building contractors involved in the cult of Amon, the primary god of Thebes (modern-day Luxor in Egypt).",2251.0,"Culture

"Attachments Depicting Busts of Silenoi, Mid–1st century B.C./mid–1st century A.D., Ancient Roman","The Greek imagination was populated with a number of strange creatures. When their thoughts turned to wine, Greeks pictured mischievous young satyrs, the half- human, half-horse creatures who frolicked, danced, and chased hapless maenads. Satyrs symbolized suppressed hedonistic desires that were unleashed by the intoxicating elixir of the wine god Dionysos, known to the Romans as Bacchus. These creatures are mature satyrs, or silenoi (sing. silenos), and they once served as decorative elements for a type of couch on which elite, well-to-do Romans reclined at lavish banquets. Because wine was served at these festive events, creatures from Dionysos’s entourage were popular subjects for such furniture attachments.",2253.0,"Culture

"Attachments Depicting Busts of Silenoi, Mid–1st century B.C./mid–1st century A.D., Ancient Roman","Each object is made of two pieces that were cast separately and fastened together. The proper right arm of the left silenos is lost, but the right one retains his separately made left arm. It and the wineskin slung over the corresponding shoulder were cast as one piece. The sclerae, or whites of their eyes, are silver, as are their teeth; furthermore, their lips were once inlaid with copper. Their remarkably animated facial expressions, with their furrowed brows and slightly parted lips, can be read as conveying pathos, perplexity, or perhaps inebriated befuddlement.",2253.0,"Culture

"Lady in Green and Gray, 1911, Thomas Wilmer Dewing","Thomas Wilmer Dewing began creating decorative paintings of women in interiors around 1886, using this
subject to explore formal issues of color and composition. Like the American painter James McNeill Whistler, whose work he certainly would have known, Dewing was especially concerned with rendering subtle distinctions of hue and value. Although the sitters were intended to be anonymous, many of them have been identified as his friends or lovers. The woman depicted in Lady in Green and Gray is Gertrude MacNeill, an actress who frequently posed for Dewing between 1911 and 1917.",2254.0,"Artist

The association ran out of funds toward the end of the project and in lieu of a final payment, they permitted French to sell bronze casts of the original statue, of which at least 11 were made at New York’s Roman Bronze Works. With his head tilted downward, Lincoln is depicted in a moment of deep thought.

"Saint Anthony Abbot, 1440/41, Fra Angelico","Trained initially as an illuminator, Fra Angelico became a Dominican friar early in his successful career as a painter. This panel was almost certainly once part of the major altarpiece that he painted shortly after 1440 for the high altar of the church of the Dominican convent of San Marco in Florence, a work commissioned by Cosimo de’ Medici. Dismantled by the early 19th century, Fra Angelico’s altarpiece had as its focal point a large central panel representing the Virgin and Child with saints; below this a predella featured episodes from the lives of the Medici patrons, Saints Cosmas (Cosimo’s namesake) and Damian. At the sides, set into the uprights of the frame, were 10 separate saints standing on clouds. Saint Anthony Abbot would have been one of these; a fourth-century Egyptian hermit, the saint was considered the founder of monasticism.",2256.0,"Artist

"The Second Knot, c. 1507, Albrecht Dürer","Around 1506, Albrecht Dürer designed a series of six ornate woodcuts of labyrinthine designs after a set of engravings by the school of Leonardo da Vinci, which he may have seen or acquired during an early trip to Italy. Though Dürer left them unsigned, possibly because he borrowed their source material, he referred in his diary to giving away his series of knots on a trip to the Netherlands, and this title has become standard. These impressions are printed on a thin, nearly translucent Italian paper, which may have influenced scholars to occasionally interpret them as embroidery patterns.",2272.0,"Artist

"Two Apaches in Paris, c. 1932, Brassaï, (Gyula Halász)","A Hungarian transplant in Paris, Brassai supported himself with work for the picture magazines of the French capital. His celebrated images of the city after dark, published in 1932 as Paris de nuit (Paris by Night), changed both the way people saw Paris and the way other photographers took pictures. Inspired by his late-night wanderings, the book shows gardens and bridges, lovers and prostitutes, the lights of bars and the backstage areas of dance halls. Although this image of two thugs from Big Albert’s gang was not included in the book, it is typical of that work, with strong contrasts of dark and light and a voyeuristic aura of menace. The black area, which reads as a wall, is actually the edge of the photograph’s frame; Brassai printed half of the image, leaving a panel of black, as if in anticipation of its dramatic impact on the page.",2273.0,"Artist

"Love’s Melancholy, 1866, Constant Mayer","Constant Mayer specialized in sentimental scenes of everyday life yet he also displayed a fidelity to nature that harmonized with the detailed landscapes painted by contemporary artists known as the Pre-Raphaelites. The young woman’s black dress, solemn disposition, and wedding ring signal a state of mourning. A church steeple in the background symbolizes her faith and purity, while the vegetation and stonework in the foreground suggest that she stands near her loved one’s grave. The golden lighting, low vantage point, and the figure’s windblown hair contribute to the air of introspection. Executed just after the Civil War, Love’s Melancholy resonated with the American public, who likely came to know the painting through a color reproduction that was produced and distributed by 1869.",2282.0,"Artist

"My Mother, March 1921, George Wesley Bellows","“There she would sit, as in a throne,” a niece once recalled of George Bellows’s mother, Anna. In this painting, which evokes the Parisian interiors of such French artists as Édouard Manet, Bellows depicted his mother in a large chair in the Victorian parlor of their family home in Columbus, Ohio. This forthright presentation of a distinguished, elderly woman with a strong character, coupled with the subdued palette, also recalls the portraiture of Thomas Eakins, whom Bellows greatly admired. The painting’s power derives in part from its highly structured composition. Influenced by the artist Jay Hambidge’s theory of dynamic symmetry, Bellows constructed the portrait in an organized, geometric arrangement of proportionate rectangles and triangles.",2292.0,"Artist
