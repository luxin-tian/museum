"Noah Smith, 1798, Ralph Earl","Ralph Earl garnered portrait commissions primarily from wealthy rural landowners in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont. A loyalist, Earl fled America for England during the Revolutionary War, developing his portrait style, in turn, by studying with Benjamin West (an American painter in London) and through contact with English artists. Returning in 1785, Earl painted this portrait of Noah Smith late in his career, having melded his British training with a simpler, linear style that appealed to his clients of the rural gentry. In this work, Smith, chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, sits assuredly before the viewer; the map at hand, pastoral view at left, and volumes of books behind him signal the sitter’s prominent position as a man of affairs in the young nation.",2300.0,"Artist

"Erasmus of Rotterdam, 1526, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer idolized the learned Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus, famously noting in his diary that Erasmus should take over for the Protestant revolutionary Martin Luther, whom Dürer feared had been killed. The artist and the scholar met three times in the Netherlands in 1520–21, and Dürer gave Erasmus several prints and drew his portrait. Erasmus also praised the artist, observing that, like artists of antiquity, “What cannot Dürer express in monochromes, that is, by black lines only?” Fittingly, Dürer’s expansive monochrome engraving includes Latin and Greek captions complimenting Erasmus’s scholarship, with his hefty tomes piled along its lower edge.",2305.0,"Artist

"The Butcher Cart, 1901, George Benjamin Luks","In The Butcher Cart, George Luks portrayed a dark view of New York street life, acknowledging modern technology and class stratification. An old-fashioned, horse-drawn cart packed with butchered pigs lumbers down a slushy street, steered by a figure hunched over the reins. In contrast to this hardworking man, middle-class urbanites shop and spend money in the background, while an elevated train—a sign of urban progress —runs on raised tracks in the distance. Known for his unromanticized depictions of lower-class communities and crowded open-air markets of lower Manhattan, Luks conveyed the physical energy of the neighborhood through bold, expressive brushwork.",2319.0,"Artist

"Dopo la Fine, 2008, Margherita Manzelli","Margherita Manzelli creates haunting, oddly ravishing images of solitary women. Her meticulously crafted paintings and delicate works on paper imagine wan, languid, at times emaciated or subtly deformed female characters isolated within an abstracted, pictorial dream space. Almost always seated or otherwise recumbent, the mute, still women are engaged in no activity other than staring, their penetrating eyes locked in a weirdly knowing confrontation with the viewer. Manzelli’s spectral women seem painfully aware of the fact that they are on display. Her characters are often attired in or surrounded by colorful, richly detailed clothing and textiles. Importantly, the artist does not work from photographs and does not use models—the figures and their environments come entirely from her imagination. Although this figure does resemble the artist, Manzelli does not consider her work to be self-portraiture.",2323.0,"Artist

"Dovima with Elephants, Evening Dress by Dior, Cirque d’Hiver, Paris, August 1955, printed 1979, Richard Avedon","Richard Avedon characterized his improvised approach to fashion photography as “a vacation from life.” Dovima with Elephants originally appeared in a 14-page story on Paris fashions published in the September 1955 issue of Harper’s Bazaar (where Avedon was staff photographer from 1946 to 1965). Avedon photographed the model known as Dovima (born Dorothy Virginia Margaret Juba) in a studio and various Paris locations, including the Cirque d’Hiver, where this image was shot. He later recounted, “I saw the elephants under an enormous skylight… . I then had to find the right dress and I knew there was a potential here for a kind of dream image.” The dress chosen was in fact the first design for Dior by 19-year-old Yves Saint Laurent. In the photograph Dovima appears poised and fearless, her sinuous contours echoing those of the massive pachyderms she seems to command.",2324.0,"Artist

The Louvre sheet bears an inscription describing the quiver, bow and scabbard drawn on the Chicago sheet, suggesting they were contiguous pages in a sketchbook (Fasanelli 1965).

The Council moved in 1439 to Florence and drew together the leaders of the Christian world, both East and West.

"Sketches of the Emperor John VIII Palaeologus, a Monk, and a Scabbard, 1438, Antonio Pisano, called Pisanello","The figures on the Chicago sheet, however, have been the subject of controversy. Originally, the horseman was thought to be the aged patriarch (Venturi 1939), but James Fasanelli (1965) suggested that the figures are only members of the Greek retinue observed in procession (including a mounted squire-dwarf) and not the principals of the Council. Michael Vickers (1978) convincingly argued that both the Chicago and Louvre sheets are almost exclusively devoted to studies of the emperor and that neither sheet bears a portrait of the patriarch. Pisanello’s medallion supports this view: while one side bears the profile portrait of the emperor, the other shows him on horseback in a landscape, equipped with the very quiver, bow, and scabbard found on the Chicago sheet.",2342.0,"Artist

"Sketches of the Emperor John VIII Palaeologus, a Monk, and a Scabbard, 1438, Antonio Pisano, called Pisanello","Based on his study of the short, “stoop-shouldered” emperor and his habits, Vickers identified not only the figure on horseback, but also the two figures at the right of the Chicago sheet, as sketches of the emperor, wearing the ceremonial robes he had received from the Sultan of Egypt. In addition, the frontal study shows him with the same short, forked beard found in Piero della Francesca’s portrayal of him as Constantine the Great in the Arezzo frescoes, including the Victory of Constantine over Maxentius (Hendy 1968, pp. 85, 91, pl. 34). Pisanello’s experimentation with postures and garb led him ultimately to opt for a mounted image in hunting attire, as the emperor seems to have spent most of his time hunting in late 1438 while staying as a guest in a convent near Ferrara. Vladimir Juren (1973, pp. 222-25) noted that John VIII Palaeologus and his brother, the despot Demetrios, bought horses for hunting from the Russian delegation when they arrived in late August of that year.",2342.0,"Artist

Dominique Cordellier (in Paris 1996a, p. 197) observed that the Louvre and Chicago sheets must have been made on one of the rare public appearances of the emperor and the patriarch Joseph II, such as the first dogmatic session of the council in Ferrara on October 8, 1438.",2342.0,"Artist

The female figure stands in a formal frontal pose, the oversize head set with staring, lozenge-shaped eyes, the nose jutting forward above a receding chin, and the open mouth showing rows of teeth. Subtly concave in the middle, the trapezoidal torso abruptly swells in the bulbous hips, belly, and thighs. The face and body are covered by burnished, deep red slip, or liquid clay, which sets off a bold pattern of cream zigzag lines; more delicate designs were drawn across the cream-painted loins and thighs. There is an uncanny visual quality to the hieratic stance, stylized proportions, and brilliant designs, all of which reflect the ritual body paint that Chupícuaro women would have worn on high ceremonial occasions some two thousand years ago.",2343.0,"Culture

"Female Figure with Bold, Geometric Face and Body Paint, 200/100 B.C., Teotihuacan","Located in Mexico’s central highlands, the principal archaeological site of Chupícuaro was on an island in the Lerma River that was submerged by the waters of a dam built in 1946 and 1947. In ancient times, trails along the riverbanks were traveled by lines of porters bearing colorful Chupícuaro pottery for trade with the growing metropolis of Teotihuacán, far to the east in the Valley of Mexico. Yet impressive Chupícuaro figures like this one were recovered from the now-inundated homeland burial grounds. It is likely that this and several known related figures commemorated a girl’s coming of age, embodying a perceived correspondence between the stages of human life and the earth’s annual cycle of birth, death, and renewal. As burial offerings, these effigies would have affirmed the matriarchal status of a high-ranking, mature, and productive member of society, recalling her initiation into womanhood and family life, and her active participation in seasonal rites devoted to securing the fertility of the soil, the abundance of crops, and the well being of the community from year to year.",2343.0,"Culture

"Hand Mirror, 470/450 BC, Ancient Etruscan","Found in women’s graves, bronze mirrors were luxurious personal possessions used in life and then buried with the dead for use in the afterlife. One side was highly polished; the other side was usually engraved with a mythic scene, such as this one, which shows the goddess Eos carrying the body of her son, Memnon, who was killed by the hero Achilles. The episode was taken from Homer’s The Iliad, the epic poem that narrates the Greek siege and eventual defeat of the city of Troy.",2346.0,"Culture
