"Variable Piece #70 (In Process): 166A, 1975/76, Douglas Huebler","Douglas Huebler used diverse systems of documentation to chronicle rule-based but unscripted events and encounters. Variable Piece #70 stands as the most ambitious project of his career—to make a photographic record of “everyone alive.” The utter futility of the premise was liberating, and Huebler would set different terms of play for each foray. For Variable Piece #70 (In Process): 166A, he asked participants to describe themselves by selecting from a set of 80 placards imprinted with different personal characteristics. This work features all five people who posed with the sign reading “One person who may be culturally dislocated.” Far from a fastidious archivist, Huebler pursued Variable Piece #70 until his death, always undermining the project’s potential rigor with allowances for subjectivity and humor.",2350.0,"Artist

"The Nativity, 1500/05, Perugino","Perugino’s serene and decorous art was widely influential in his native region of Umbria and beyond, most famously through his contact with the young Raphael. These four panels, together with another one depicting the Resurrection, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, once constituted a predella—a series of small pictures, often with narrative content, forming the base of an altarpiece. In this case, the painting that was positioned above the predella as the focal point of the altarpiece is unidentified. The predella scenes depict moments when Christ’s special nature was revealed: his birth, his baptism by Saint John the Baptist in the river Jordan, his conversation with a woman of Samaria at the well of the patriarch Jacob, the Resurrection, and his appearance to Mary Magdalene after the Resurrection.",2356.0,"Artist

"Fountain of Neptune, 1902, John Singer Sargent","Best known for his society portraits, John Singer Sargent was likewise adept at landscapes and architectural studies, practices that he increasingly pursued after 1900 in both oil and watercolor. Fountain of Neptune depicts a portion of the famous 16th-century fountain in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence. Painting his composition on site, en plein air, Sargent chose an up-close, truncated view of the sculpture, focusing not on the god of Neptune, but on the twisting, muscular bodies of other bronze figures adorning the fountain. The play of light on intricate surfaces of architecture and decoration is the composition’s principal subject.",2362.0,"Artist

"Two Girls in a Garden, 1914, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff","Karl Schmidt-Rottluff was a founding member of Brücke (Bridge). Formed in 1905 in Dresden, the group sought to forge an art that would be a bridge to Germany’s great artistic past. Brücke renounced academic painting and promoted a more intuitive approach that drew on non-Western and outsider sources. The intentionally rough and angular style of Two Girls in a Garden demonstrates Schmidt-Rottluff’s interest in African sculpture, which he studied in the Dresden Ethnographic Museum. To combat the devolution of modern society, the members of Brücke praised nature and frequently communed together in the countryside. Though by 1914 Schmidt-Rottluff had moved to Berlin, nature would remain an important source of inspiration in his art.",2363.0,"Artist

The lunette A Glimpse into Hell, or Fear is drawn from 14th-century poet Dante Alighieri’s Inferno, the first part of his epic poem, Divine Comedy. Here, five females confront the gate of Hell. Beholding such a sight, they express apprehension and fear, accentuated by the swirling forms of their draperies and hair.

"Armored Guardian (Tomb Figure), Tang dynasty (A.D. 618–906), late 7th/early 8th century","Ceramic figures made for burial in the tombs of princes and officials vividly evoke aspects of the elite life of China’s expansive and multicultural Tang dynasty (618-907). This armored guardian of haughty, impenetrable expression stands on a rocky plinth and was probably stationed close to the burial chamber to repel potential evil. One hand turns down in a clenched fist and the other turns upward with an outstretched finger, suggesting that both hands once brandished a weapon, now lost. His multilayered parade armor combines a helmet with upturned earflaps; neck and shoulder guards; scalloped breast and backplates secured by knotted ropes over a tunic with pleated hem; flared elbow cuffs over long, tight sleeves; and protective leggings under a sweeping skirt. The elements of this elaborate uniform were meticulously modeled in clay before firing and richly embellished with colors and gold pigment afterward.
Because these so-called ""cold pigments"" are more vulnerable to deterioration than fired glazes, only traces of the most detailed patterns survive. These combine curled tendrils and scalloped floral scrolls on the armor, giving elegantly decorative flourishes to the armor of this impassive figure.
Unlike most Tang figures that were formed in molds, this guardian appears to have been primarily hand-modeled, probably from coils of clay. It has survived remarkably intact; examination by museum conservators revealed only minimal restoration.",2381.0,"Title

"Ocean Park No. 45, 1971, Richard Diebenkorn","A noted painter and printmaker, Richard Diebenkorn was widely recognized for his large-scale, luminous
abstractions. The titles of Diebenkorn’s paintings often allude to the places that inspired them or in which they were made. His move to the Los Angeles area in 1966 led to a dramatic change in his work. The artist’s best-known paintings belong to the Ocean Park series—named for the section of Santa Monica where
his studio was located—which he began in 1967 and continued for 20 years. The series comprises more than 140 paintings. These iconic works are distinguished by geometric structures, perhaps evoking the idea of a view from the studio window, overlaid with glazes of atmospheric color. In many ways, Diebenkorn sought to distill the emptiness of this landscape: sea and sky, beach and freeway.",2383.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Soap Bubble Set), c. 1957, Joseph Cornell","Soap bubble sets were among Cornell’s earliest imaginary constructions, going back to his contribution to the 1936–37 exhibition Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism at The Museum of Modern Art in New York. This box forms an interesting contrast with the other Soap Bubble Set in the Bergman collection (see Soap Bubble Set). Here the bold form of the moon fills the back panel, its pitted surface finding an echo in the cork ball suspended on the parallel rods. Like the earlier box, this one includes a drinking glass. A clay pipe lying on the floor of the box forges the link between the “bubbles” and the planets. Cornell seems to wish to counteract, however, the obviously poetic, dreamlike connotations of this box by emphasizing the scientific interest of the moon through its precisely “mapped” surface and the tables with astronomical data pasted in at the left and right.",2384.0,"Artist

Lautréamont was central to the alternative literary genealogy the Surrealists constructed for themselves; his violent, gothic epic, Les Chants de Maldoror, was particularly valued for its extraordinary poetic images, such as the famous metaphor ""as beautiful as the chance encounter on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella"" (Oeuvres complétes, Paris, 1963 ed.,rev. and enl., p. 327), which virtually became the Surrealist’s motto.",2385.0,"Artist

"Imaginary Portrait of Lautréamont at the Age of Nineteen Obtained According to the Paranoiac-Critical Method, 1937, Salvador Dalí","Very little was known about Lautréamont, however. Dalí claimed the portrait was obtained using his ""paranoiac-critical"" method, which he thought of as a ""spontaneous method of irrational knowledge"" (Salvador Dalí, Conquest of the Irrational, New York, 1935, p. 15). Usually, this method involved altenative readings of objective phenomena, as in the double images with which he was experimenting at this time (see The Image Disappears), which Dalí described as a form of delirium. Here, however, it seems there was no original object of image to provoke the paranoiac associations; the image developed spontaneously by a process of intense concentration of the imagination. Dalí once compared himself to a medium, able to ""see"" images ""that would spring up in my imagination: (Salvador Dalí, The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí, New York, 1961, tr. by Haakon M. Chevalier, p. 220), which he could the situate on the blank page of canvas.",2385.0,"Artist

"Imaginary Portrait of Lautréamont at the Age of Nineteen Obtained According to the Paranoiac-Critical Method, 1937, Salvador Dalí","The focus on certain details and the emphasis on a single, gazing eye recall other portraits by Dalí of this period, most significantly his self-portraits in Impressions of Africa and related preparatory drawings for this painting of 1938 (Rotterdam, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen; Descharnes and Néret 1994, vol. 1, pld. 671-73). Dalí may also have taken a cue from a mysterious image, a very detailed pencil drawing of a single eye, reproduced in La Révolution surréaliste (2 [Jan. 15, 1925], p. 25) with the caption""Marcel Proust, par Georges Bessiére."" Imagery centering on eyes or an eye is ubiquitous in Surrealist art, where it usually stands paradoxically for the idea of internal rather than external vision. Lautrémont was regarder by the Surrealists as one of the great visionaries.",2385.0,"Artist

"The Prairie on Fire, 1827, Alvan Fisher","Alvan Fisher was a pioneering American landscapist whose work offered an important precedent for the Hudson River School. This painting depicts a subject from James Fenimore Cooper’s 1827 novel The Prairie, the third of the five Leatherstocking Tales. In this scene, Natty Bumppo, the hero of the series, has created a firebreak to protect the story’s protagonists. As a Romantic-era artist, Fisher preferred such dramatic episodes, which involved striking contrasts between light and dark. Unlike contemporaneous illustrations of the scene, which give little sense of setting, in this version the figures are dwarfed by nature, and the prairie grasses are exquisitely rendered, underscoring the landscape’s beauty as well as its dangers. The work thus suggests the significance of the prairie in Cooper’s text. Perhaps for this reason, the author declared that it was “the only good illustration he had seen from his books.”",2398.0,"Artist
