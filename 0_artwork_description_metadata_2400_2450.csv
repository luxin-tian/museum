"Amphora (Storage Jar), 530/520 BC, Ancient Greek","This large vessel was used for storing and mixing wine, and was likely used as part of the Greek symposium. Much like modern academic symposiums, in which people discuss a topic of common interest, debunking old theories and putting forth new hypotheses; the men of ancient Athens regularly got together in private homes to exchange ideas. Afterward the participants might continue the conversation, discussing their impressions in greater detail or simply socializing over a drink. As the evening progressed, participants engaged in other pleasures, including games, performances, and sex. Wine played a major role in fueling these evenings, and as such the myriad vessels used in the symposium often paid homage to drink. Here, the face or mask of a satyr, one of the followers of the wine god Dionysos, is depicted with grapevines seemingly growing from his head.",2401.0,"Culture

"Untitled (Lighted Owl), c. 1949, Joseph Cornell","Cornell’s bird boxes often play with forms of representation and with the contrast between the natural and the artificial. In his trips into the countryside, he would often gather materials for his boxes, and in this one, the large, angular piece of bark placed toward the right interior edge may be the lump Cornell reported finding in January 1948 and described as “magnificently dried bark for owl bark, single piece, for owl boxes” (Cornell 1993, p. 152). In any case it adds a sense of depth to the box by providing a kind of opened curtain, from behind which the owl is revealed. The sheet of blue glass renders the interior as dark as a forest at night, and the small electric bulb above, when lit, suggests moonlight. The dramatic chiaroscuro effect prompts comparison with photography, as well as underlining the contrast between the two-dimensional pictorial representation of the owl and its “real” habitat. The numerous worm holes in the wood frame are the result of simulated rather than authentic insect damage and appear to be original to the box‘s construction.

"The Battle of St. James The Greater at Clavijo, n.d., School of Martin Schongauer","Saint James the Greater (died a.d. 44) was one of Christ’s apostles and the patron saint of Spain. He was said to have miraculously appeared, sword in hand, to help the Christian Spaniards defeat a Muslim army in a.d. 844—a battle that in fact never happened. The scene here abounds in gritty details such as the beheaded enemy corpse and various dismembered limbs. The saint wears a scallop shell on his hat, an allusion to the sign pilgrims wore on their long journey to revere his relics at the Spanish cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.",2409.0,"Artist

"Noli Me Tangere, 1500/05, Perugino","Perugino’s serene and decorous art was widely influential in his native region of Umbria and beyond, most famously through his contact with the young Raphael. These four panels, together with another one depicting the Resurrection, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, once constituted a predella—a series of small pictures, often with narrative content, forming the base of an altarpiece. In this case, the painting that was positioned above the predella as the focal point of the altarpiece is unidentified. The predella scenes depict moments when Christ’s special nature was revealed: his birth, his baptism by Saint John the Baptist in the river Jordan, his conversation with a woman of Samaria at the well of the patriarch Jacob, the Resurrection, and his appearance to Mary Magdalene after the Resurrection.",2417.0,"Artist

"Polycrates’ Crucifixion, c. 1664, Salvator Rosa","Salvator Rosa developed a kind of dramatic landscape in which nature is presented as wild, dangerous, and filled with striking effects of light, broken trees, jagged cliffs, and dark grottoes. A native of Naples, Rosa settled in Rome in 1649, producing dramatic works that are regarded as counter-parts to the calm, classical landscapes of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. Rosa’s dark style is well suited to the subject of this pair of paintings; they recount an episode from the Greco-Persian Wars as told by the ancient Green historian Herodotus. The ruler of the island of Samos, Polycrates, had been blessed with remarkable good fortune. In an effort to ward off a reversal of fortune, he cast a precious ring into the sea, but it was returned to him, swallowed by a fish. His good fortune came to an end, however, when he was entrapped by Oroetus of Sardis and put to death.",2422.0,"Artist

"Tobacco Premium Quilt, 1913, Theresa Zett Smith","In the early twentieth century, ladies’ magazines and tobacco companies encouraged women to collect and use fabric premiums to make decorative items for the home, such as quilts and pillows. The premiums, which included items such as the printed cotton flags seen in this quilt, either came with a tobacco purchase or could be redeemed with coupons collected from the packages. The promotion was designed to incentivize tobacco consumption and encourage brand loyalty. Although many social commentators of the time regarded smoking as unladylike, men were free to indulge without fear of judgement.

"Untitled #92, 1981, Cindy Sherman","Cindy Sherman is a major figure in the contemporary revival of directed, or staged, photography. Her work explores the pervasive effects that mass-media images have upon the construction, assumption, and projection of individual identities. Since the late 1970s, the artist has served as both photographer and model for a large cast of fictional personalities created through changes in costume, hair (usually a wig), makeup, and lighting. Sherman first gained recognition for a series of black-and-white works that imitate the look and feel of stills from popular films of the 1950s and 1960s. In 1981 she began a series of large color photographs that mimic the horizontal format of a magazine centerfold. Though formally reminiscent of such glossy spreads, Sherman’s representations are fraught with anxiety, vulnerability, and longing. In Untitled #92, she depicted herself in a moment of cinematic distress, crouched on the floor with wet hair. Her costume—white blouse and plaid skirt—evokes a school uniform, and her well-manicured hands offer evidence of some unknown struggle. An imposing darkness surrounds her but a bright light, suggestive of a flashlight or the headlights of a car, illuminates her blank expression.",2435.0,"Artist

Artisans used molds to produce images of both men and women.

Though Dürer left them unsigned, possibly because he borrowed their source material, he referred in his diary to giving away his series of knots on a trip to the Netherlands, and this title has become standard. These impressions are printed on a thin, nearly translucent Italian paper, which may have influenced scholars to occasionally interpret them as embroidery patterns.",2439.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1969, Cy Twombly","Cy Twombly is best known for a synthesis of drawing, painting, and writing that balances abstract with suggestively pictorial impulses. His inimitable scribbles and scrawls are at once intuitive and sublime, casual or even crude and refined. Twombly made the dynamic, brooding Untitled as one in a suite of fourteen large-scale paintings during the summer of 1969 while ensconced at Palazzo del Drago on the shores of Lake Bolsena in central Italy. Against a rich, creamy ground, he elaborated on the cascades of planar and tubular shapes that had emerged in his painting the year before, using diagram-like forms to imbue the canvas with a sense of spatiotemporal flow, as well as a certain airiness. On the other hand, the white field—darkened here and there by passages of erasure—also takes on the aspect of a heavily revised mathematical worksheet. Twombly was immersed both in his work and in his particular location, titling these paintings with the place-name Bolsena. But while typically he might find inspiration in the history of his ancient rural retreat, in this case he was as attuned to that summer’s defining moment: the Apollo II moon landing. Such context enhances our reading of the painting’s enigmatic visual language of measurement, drift, and direction.",2447.0,"Artist

"Still Life in Interior, 1920/22, Preston Dickinson","A leading American modernist painter, Preston Dickinson was exposed to French avant-garde art while studying in Paris between 1911 and 1914. Pictures such as Still Life in Interior demonstrate his interest in the tension between representation and abstraction. Here Dickinson depicted magazines, a sake bottle, a tea canister painted with Japanese figures, and a cup and saucer. His composition employs a tilted perspective reminiscent of Paul Cézanne’s still lifes, a Cubist fracturing of space, and the bold,
complementary colors typical of American Synchromists like Stanton MacDonald-Wright. Dickinson achieved
great critical success in the 1920s but died of pneumonia at the age of 41.",2448.0,"Artist
