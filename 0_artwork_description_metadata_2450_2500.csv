"Fishing Boats off an Estuary, 1633, Jan van Goyen","With its low horizon line, monochrome palette, and direct paint handling, this intimate panel is characteristic of the river landscapes of Jan van Goyen’s early maturity. He used the white ground to impart a luminous tonality to his rapidly brushed paintings. In a society that provided a broad market for art, Van Goyen was an active dealer, auctioneer, and appraiser, as well as a prolific maker of art.",2451.0,"Artist

"Wedding Ensemble for a Bride (Umtshakazi), 1950s, Thembu","For the Thembu and other Xhosa-speaking peoples, the beauty, translucence, and weight of layers of beaded ornaments have spiritual dimensions. Shiny, reflective materials are associated with enlightenment, purity, and access to the ancestral realm. Thembu beadworking flourished among young women in the 1940s and 1950s, but declined in the 1960s. Each of the items in this wedding ensemble was lovingly made. Many are notable for their creative reuse of materials: for example, the bracelet from which a handkerchief is suspended; the armlets made of twisted brass wire; and the beaded teaspoon necklaces, which were intended to make the marriage sweet.",2453.0,"Culture

"New York with View of the Flatiron Building, 1910, John Marin","This lively work painted over a graphite sketch is a view looking down Broadway to the Flatiron Building at the corner of Twenty-Third Street and Fifth Avenue. The tall, narrow structure, seven blocks from Stieglitz’s gallery 291, was also the subject of photographs by Marin’s friends Stieglitz and Edward Steichen. This sheet demonstrates Marin’s increasingly fluid handling of paint, particularly where he pulled his brush, loaded with blue wash, around the tops of the buildings. Tilting the paper upright, he allowed the watercolor to pool at the end of each stroke, creating a vibrant pattern of gradating tone.",2455.0,"Artist

"Pavilion, 1953, Joseph Cornell","Cornell crated complex spatial and visual effects in Pavilion by using fragments of mirrors in various positions within the construction. These allow for different views of the interior as the spectator changes position. This is particularly true of the mirror on the bottom of the wood shelf a long the top of the right interior wall, which gives a view of the interior of the box as if seen from above. These mirror fragments also vary greatly in shape. As noted in the above media description, there are four fragments of mirror on the rear interior wall: the tips of the two long, curved fragments, which look like sickle moons, almost touch; a third piece, in the lower left corner, is roughly triangular; and the fourth fragment is straight.",2460.0,"Artist

"The Birth of Saint John the Baptist, About 1525, Artist unknown","This polychromed and gilded relief was probably once part of a large carved altarpiece with scenes from the life of Saint John the Baptist. The tightly swaddled infant Baptist is the center of attention as he is passed between his mother, Saint Elizabeth, and a kneeling attendant. The well-preserved relief combines, a riot of rich colors and pattern in the treatment of fabrics with figures that show a Renaissance impulse towards volume and weight. It reflects the influence of the sculptors Felipe Vigarny and Diego de Siloe, who worked together in Burgos in the early 1520s; the relief may have been made in the region of Burgos.",2463.0,"Artist

"Industry, 1927, Charles Sheeler","This maquette is the only surviving version of a seven-by-twelve foot photographic mural created by Charles Sheeler for an exhibition on mural art at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. Murals, promoted in the Americas and Europe in the 1930s, created a vast new space of display for painters and photographers, who, like Sheeler, freely crossed media boundaries to make the giant compositions. The multiple source photographs in this maquette, all taken by Sheeler, depict the Ford Motor Company’s plant in River Rouge, near Detroit, where the artist traveled in 1927 as part of a commission to make publicity pictures for the company. The left and right sections of the triptych are halves of a single photograph, while the central portion represents a montage of three other pictures taken at the plant. The bold leaps in scale and subject are what made murals of the 1930s—both painted and photographic—impressive in their dynamism.",2469.0,"Artist

"Mask (Mukudj), Late 19th/early 20th century, Ashiru","Wooden masks whitened with kaolin have been common among the Ashiru, Punu, Lumbo and neighboring groups in south and south central Gabon and the southwestern regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the late 19th century. Known as mukudj, these masks appear in masquerades during funeral celebrations and other events of importance to the community. The masked male dancers, wearing a fiber costume over stilts, perform a variety of movements and acrobatics requiring extensive training.
This mask is defined by an elaborate and highly stylized bi-lobed coiffure, painted black, which frames an idealized female face. The face is painted white with kaolin, which both references the earthly beauty of the woman represented and symbolizes the spirits of past ancestors. The diamond-shaped scarification marks on the forehead and the square-shaped marks on the temples emphasize the perfect, symmetrical beauty of the face, with its dramatically arched eyebrows, almond-shaped slit eyes, small ears, delicate nose, and slightly protruding mouth and chin. Mukudj masks became extremely popular among European art collectors during the 1920s and 1930s, as their aestheticized and abstract attributes intersected with the ideals of modern art. Today the Punu especially embrace the mukudj mask as a sign of ethnic identity, thus often displaying them within their private domestic spaces and incorporating them into a host of celebrations and communal events.

"Trouville (Grey and Green, the Silver Sea), 1865, James McNeill Whistler","In the early 1860s, James McNeill Whistler began to develop an art-for-art’s-sake aesthetic, eschewing narrative or naturalistic details to focus more intently on formal concerns. In 1865 the artist traveled to Trouville, a French resort town, where he painted with Gustave Courbet and experimented with a series of increasingly simplified seascapes. The high horizon line and broad expanses of muted color in this spare composition reveal Whistler’s interest in Japanese woodblock prints. The sweeping, horizontal brushstrokes and restrained palette, limited to pale greens and soft grays, reinforce the painting’s innovative, flattened perspective.",2486.0,"Artist

With their spontaneous brushwork and lyrical interplay of primary hues, these paintings established Francis as one of the foremost colorists of the postwar era. The artist often found inspiration in literary works and kept a notebook containing titles of books and verses. He named this and a related painting (In Lovely Blueness No. 1, 1955–57) after a poem by the German Romantic writer Friedrich Hölderlin, hoping to capture the poem’s sublime imagery and prophetic vision.",2489.0,"Artist

"The Blue Forest, 1925, Max Ernst","Max Ernst was one of the most gifted artists associated with Surrealism, exhibiting a protean imagination that led him to produce work in an unusually wide range of styles and techniques. This painting belongs to a period, from 1925 to 1928, that was perhaps the most productive and creative of his long career. Most of the artist’s extraordinarily rich work of these years depended, directly or indirectly, on a technique referred to as frottage (rubbing), which Ernst used to stimulate his imagination, encouraged in this by Surrealist theories about the processes of inspiration. This technique consisted in placing a piece of paper over a textured object or surface and then rubbing it with a pencil or other tool to obtain an image. Using this method as his point of departure, Ernst produced in 1925 a series of exceptionally beautiful drawings, thirty-four of which were published the following year under the title Histoire naturelle (Natural History). This painting shares with these drawings a stark and delicate beauty. Like many other works of this period, it was produced by adapting frottage to oil painting. The techniques used included scraping paint off the canvas, a procedure Ernst called grattage (scraping), or rubbing a cloth dipped in paint over the canvas, as it lay on a variety of textured surfaces from wood planks and wire mesh, as in this case, to string, chair caning, shells, and many other materials. As the title of Ernst’s portfolio of drawings indicates, many of his works of these years allude to the natural world. The ""Forest"" series, exemplified by this painting, resumed a popular Romantic theme that continued to fascinate Surrealist artists(compare, for example, the work of Ernst’s close friend Jean Arp) as a repository of mysterious, primeval forces.
Here the chance patterns produced by the wood grain of several wood planks have been transformed into a cluster of towering forms, outlined against a pale sky flecked with blue, yellow, and green. The forest’s floor presents a honeycomb pattern seemingly produced by means of a wire mesh, a pattern that is echoed in the sky in scattered bursts of color. The spare simplicity of this image enhances its associative powers, as we are drawn into our own cosmic reverie about a primordial world, encompassing far more than the forest mentioned in the title. Ernst’s works thus become, in his own words, a kind of ""hypnotic language [that] takes us back to a lost paradise, to cosmic secrets, and teaches us to understand the language of the universe.""
