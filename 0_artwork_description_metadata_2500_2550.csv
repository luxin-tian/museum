"Secretary Cabinet, c. 1775, David Roentgen","David Roentgen was a German craftsman and entrepreneur who made furniture for some of the grandest patrons in Europe, including Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia, and Marie Antoinette of France. A brilliant artist in marquetry, Roentgen employed twenty varieties of wood in this desk, including American black walnut, which European craftsmen first began using at just this time.",2501.0,"Artist

"Secretary Cabinet, c. 1775, David Roentgen","The desk’s form is inspired by a design for a desk and bookcase in the English furniture maker Thomas Chippendale’s book The Gentleman and Cabinet Makers Director, published in 1754. Roentgen adapted Chippendale’s design, changing the top to a broken scrolled pediment more in keeping with the German Rococo style. The marquetry designs conjure exotic figures standing on what look like dilapidated stage sets. The depiction of these half-ruined structures became occasions for marquetry cutters to display their virtuosity. Details of birds and trees add to the charming decoration, in which the playful fantasy characteristic of chinoiserie is given free rein.",2501.0,"Artist

"Wine, Cheese, and Fruit, 1857, John F. Francis","Succulent grapes, crumbling cheese, sparkling wine in elegant glasses, and cognac in tumblers are depicted in this opulent dessert picture by John Francis. Originally an itinerant portrait painter, Francis turned to still life in the mid-19th century when the availability of daguerreotype portraits rendered his trade obsolete. The penchant for household embellishment among the Victorian middle class created a lively market for still-life paintings, which were often hung in dining rooms. While spirits are featured prominently in this painting, the glasses that are less than half full and the presence of the water indicate balance and restraint, referring to the mid-century growth of the temperance movement, which promoted the ideals of moderation and self-control.",2504.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1988, Kiki Smith","Kiki Smith has been instrumental in shifting the abstract rhetoric of the human form in art into a grounded conversation about the body, particularly as it is defined in social and political terms. Her figurative sculpture examines the physical and spiritual nature of the body by presenting it in an abject, fragmented, and damaged state. Untitled, which is one of only a few sculptures by Smith that investigates the male form, is executed in tissue-thin gampi paper—a fragile and ephemeral material—to convey the porous and permeable quality of skin. Here, as in much of Smith’s work, the artist engaged viewers in issues of individual and collective health and disease, heroization and victimization, and life and death.",2508.0,"Artist

"Hussar’s Armor, 1675/1700","For better mobility, some light cavalrymen, such as the legendary Polish hussars, wore half armor. The hussars, an elite branch of the Polish army, went into battle in glittering armor on magnificent horses, seldom losing a battle though they were many times outnumbered by the enemy. Recruited from among the wealthiest of Poland’s nobility, the hussars were accomplished horsemen, famous for the huge ""wings"" worn on their backs or attached to their saddles. These wings were made of wooden wing-shaped frames with eagle feathers inserted into the back rims. The thunderous noise made by the flapping of these extra appendages during a charge was meant to frighten the enemy horses. Known as ""winged horsemen,"" the colorfully costumed hussars also wore leopard or similar animal skins in the style of cloaks over the pauldrons (shoulder pieces) of their armor.",2511.0,"Title

"Back on Earth, 1981, Elizabeth Murray","Beginning in 1976, Elizabeth Murray developed a reputation for her brightly colored, sculptural, shaped canvases, which illustrate objects and figures from her daily life. Influenced by Cubism, Abstract Expressionism, and comic art, her vibrant and energetic visual language playfully complicates the formal attributes of painting. In Back on Earth, two grandly scaled canvases—one geometric (blue), the other biomorphic (green)—are inextricably linked by the artist’s assertive use of color and rambunctious imagery. The animated, squidlike table is a recurring motif in Murray’s paintings and is utilized here to visually link the canvases and to further confound the relationship between figure and ground.",2523.0,"Artist

"Twelve Jackies, 1964, Andy Warhol","Pop artist Andy Warhol’s fascination with fame and his complicated veneration of popular culture permeated every aspect of his career. Early on he adopted the commercial printing process of photoemulsion silk screen applied to canvas as a means of reproducing the same image, over and over, quickly and efficiently. His studio became known as the Factory, a reference to his preference for mass production. He embraced both household goods and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor as products, and vice versa. He also recognized that notoriety could be found even in tragedy. Twelve Jackies comes from a body of work created shortly after the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. As was his practice, Warhol worked from existing imagery; in this case, press photography from the slain president’s funeral. By cropping and enlarging the selected image of the veiled former First Lady, Warhol focuses attention on his “star” much like a director using a close-up lens. The effect is a chilling glamorization of the tragic. Warhol’s use of repetition not only emphasizes the feeling of mourning and loss but also imports a cinematic quality to the work. This emphasis parallels the artist’s interest in the language of film as well as his growing involvement at this time in the world of underground cinema.",2525.0,"Artist

Bishamon (also known as Tamonten or Vaisravana) is the chief of the four guardian devas (or shitennō) who protect the four cardinal directions in a Buddhist sanctuary. Together, they defend the entire world against evil and promote the seeking of enlightenment.

"Bishamon, 11th century","Glaring at those who pose danger to the Buddhist law, Bishamon is clothed in full armor, ready to take on the Buddha’s enemies. The figure is carved from wood in an intricate style that conveys action while also paying attention to the smallest details of his costume. The dynamic representation of Bishamon’s figure—the sway of his hips and the opposing movements of his arms, with his sleeves swinging as if caught in a divine breeze—effectively expresses the guardian’s strength and determination. His elaborate helmet is actually carved from the same piece of wood as the head. The plated armor was elaborately decorated with dragons, flowers, and other patterns depicted in gold and bright colors, ample traces of which remain. Bishamon once held a miniature reliquary in the upturned palm of his left hand and a sword in the right, symbolizing his duty to defend the Buddhist law.",2529.0,"Title

A patera was typically used to pour libations, but this example is unusually large. Bands of varying width containing repetitive patterns and scrolling tendrils interrupted by female heads surround a central scene depicting Hermes, the god of travelers, leading the harvest goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone from the underworld, where the girl had been held captive by Hades. Persephone was forced to return for part of every year, and during that time Demeter’s displeasure would cause the fertile earth to turn barren. Her story symbolized the life, death, and rebirth of both crops and people.",2534.0,"Culture

"Cross and Weather Vane, 1935, Arthur Dove","In 1933, Arthur Dove and his wife, Helen Torr, moved to Geneva, New York, where Dove had been raised, to settle his family’s estate following the death of his mother. Although ambivalent about returning to his childhood home, Dove found renewed inspiration in the local landscape and began exploring it in depth, making numerous sketches and watercolors that became the basis for canvases such as Cross and Weather Vane. The composition incorporates several natural motifs such as trees, rolling hills, and the round orb of the sun that recur with frequency in Dove’s work and affirm his passion for nature. These elements mingle harmoniously with the manmade objects in the painting, such as the arrow-shaped weather vane, which seems to take flight like a bird. The small brown cross, which appears to be embedded in a gray, rocklike form, serves as a reminder of Dove’s belief in the interconnectedness of spirituality and nature.",2542.0,"Artist
