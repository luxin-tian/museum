"Circus Elephants, 1941, John Marin","Among Marin’s favorite subjects in the 1930s and 1940s was the circus, a theme he worked on both in the city and at Cape Split. An avid circus visitor, he enjoyed the spectacle and sketching the animals. Marin loved the elephants most, responding to the dignity and grandeur of their movements. He began this watercolor by drawing the creatures and their surroundings with graphite and crayon. He then painted the forms with transparent watercolor, returning to add black crayon for the deepest lines. Painted, drawn, and subtracted diagonal marks conjure the effect of spotlights. The soft effect of wiping also contributes to the overall impression of dust hanging in the illuminated air, enhancing the artist’s evocation of heat, smells, and sounds.",2556.0,"Artist

"Being Not Truthful Always Works Against Me (edition 1/10), 2006, Stefan Sagmeister","Stefan Sagmeister’s graphic designs are often unsettling, engaging the viewer through a combination of subtle wit and humor, married with sinister undertones and references drawn from popular culture. The project Being Not Truthful Always Works against Me was created in collaboration with Ralph Ammer, and it is comprised of those words digitally woven into a projected spiderweb. As a viewer passes in front of the work, a sensor captures the movement, and the web begins to break down, resulting in its eventual destruction and dissolution. However, when the viewer has gone, the web reconstructs itself time and again, playfully mimicking the regenerating power of an actual spider through digital means.",2559.0,"Artist

"Octadrachm (Coin) Portraying King Ptolemy III Euergetes, Ptolemaic Period (221–205 BC), issued by King Ptolemy IV, reign of Ptolemy III Euergetes (247–222 BC), Ancient Greek","Under the rule of Ptolemy III, Egypt’s realm reached its greatest geographical limits, stretching from Cyrene in North Africa to Babylon in Mesopotamia. Rather than pursue further conquests, Ptolemy concentrated on developing prosperity within Egypt. His reign marks the apogee of the dynasty’s power. Surprisingly, Ptolemy III never issued a coin with his own portrait, rather this coin was struck by his son Ptolemy IV and presents the dead king with the attributes of three gods: the crown of Helios, the sun god; the armor of Zeus; and the trident of the sea god, Poseidon.",2564.0,"Culture

"Exotics, 1939, Paul Klee","From the mid-1920s until 1933, Paul Klee taught a design class for the weaving workshop of the Bauhaus, a German art school combining ne art and craft. Concurrent with his classroom interaction with student weavers, Klee began to use increasingly unusual fabrics in his paintings, including cotton, jute, and silk, to explore the interaction between paint and the many distinct textures of his supports. In late works such as Exotics, painted on coarse burlap, Klee recalled his formative journeys to Tunisia and Egypt in 1914 and 1928, respectively. While these trips to North Africa, then under occupation by France and Great Britain, originally positioned him as an adventurer in the eyes of his contemporaries, the rough-hewn, woven character of the painting’s support was an expression of his long-standing interest in weaving.",2566.0,"Artist

"Pair of Tomb Chamber Doors, Western Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 9), 1st century B.C.","In northern China during the Han dynasty, hollow clay bricks were used to construct the small, rectangular chambers of underground tombs. The doors, pillars, and lintel assembled here reconstruct the entrance to such a chamber. Before firing, the bricks were stamped with vigorous images from daily life and from mythology. This combination of subject matters reflects a dualistic view of the human soul: separating at death, one part of the soul was thought to remain in the earthly tomb, while the other ascended to a paradise—the realm of ancestral spirits and of the special beings who have achieved immortality.",2569.0,"Title

"Pair of Tomb Chamber Doors, Western Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 9), 1st century B.C.","Guardian images, both realistic and symbolic, are centered on each door. Two long-robed men (identified by inscription as tingzhang, village officials) flank another protective symbol, a ring-snouted monster mask. Surrounding this central square are border strips depicting scenes of entertainment and of animals, hunters, and chariots charging across mountains. Winged xian—immortal, elf-like figures—are also depicted in a mountainous setting. Other emblematic designs that appear repeatedly on these doors include a spade-shaped evergreen tree, designating family continuity and longevity, and a disk enclosing a bird in flight, which can be identified with the sun.
On the lintel above, soldiers bearing shields flank a protective monster mask. On either side of this mask, jade disks tied by cords may symbolize prosperity or other auspicious wishes for the soul. Other auspicious symbols include the dragon and phoenix (also known as the Red Bird), identified in Han cosmological texts as the animals of the east and south, respectively.",2569.0,"Title

"The Valley of Arconville, c. 1887, Theodore Robinson","One of the first American artists to paint in Giverny, France, Theodore Robinson assimilated the teachings of the region’s most famous resident, Claude Monet, in his vibrant compositions. In this striking panoramic view of the French valley of Arconville, southeast of Paris, Robinson employed densely layered, broken brushwork—learned from his friend and mentor Monet—to lead the eye away from the figure of the woman, down the slope, and across the valley. Although Robinson, like the French Impressionists, here captured momentary effects such as the illusion of grass moving in the breeze, the geometric forms of the houses below add structure to the image.",2572.0,"Artist

"Weehawken, New Jersey, 1910, John Marin","Unified by somber blue-gray washes painted wet-into-wet and enlivened by small touches of bright, warm color, this sheet recalls watercolors Marin painted of the Seine River. Imbued with the quiet mood of a Whistler nocturne, this watercolor also utilizes an important motif from Chinese painting: the artist suggested the spiky branches of a bare tree with strokes of black watercolor, gracefully balancing and screening the view of the distant skyline. The riverbank at Weehawken was a site Marin knew from his youth; that he was drawn back to it for this perspective on the metropolis bears out his statement, “As for subject matter—I go places intimate to me and in those intimate places I start to paint my painting.”",2580.0,"Artist

"Casket, 12th century","This type of ornately painted ivory casket survived in relatively large numbers in church treasuries. Judging from their Arabic inscriptions, which contain wishes for happiness, blessings, or glory, it is likely that many of them were originally intended for secular use as wedding gifts or jewelry boxes. However, they were often later used as reliquaries. Here traces of an inscription on the front rim and cover read, ""May glory endure"".
