"Head of an Official, Middle Kingdom, Dynasty 13 (1773–1650 BC), Ancient Egyptian","This head from a life-sized statue was probably produced for the tomb of a local government official. In the tomb, the statue symbolically partook of offerings that were left for his soul. Stone images of the deceased also functioned as links between the dead and the living: they were tangible reminders of the physical form of the deceased.",2610.0,"Culture

"Plaque, 16th/17th century, Edo","During the 16th century, coastal trade made brass amply available in the Kingdom of Benin. King Esigie (reigned about 1504–about 1550) exploited the inflow by commissioning his court’s brass casters to make commemorative plaques for his palace. The warrior depicted here wears a coral-studded cap and collar indicating his rank. The horseshoe shape in the upper left corner represents a copper or brass ring known as a manilla. Manufactured in Europe, such rings were used as currency among the Benin people.",2611.0,"Culture

"Holy Family, 1440/60, Northern Netherlandish School","This view of the Holy Family in an interior is filled with the trappings of a comfortable bourgeois existence. Its unknown maker was probably working from a repertory of pattern drawings derived from the most innovative Netherlandish painters of the early 15th century, Rogier van der Weyden and Jan van Eyck. The pose of the Virgin and the buffet with its brass and pewter vessels are particularly indebted to their work. At the same time, the painting’s dry style and its use of a spruce rather than an oak panel for the support are indications that it was made in Southern Germany.",2613.0,"Artist

"Fishing off Scarborough, 1882, Winslow Homer","During Homer’s sojourn in England from 1881 to 1882, he rented a studio on a cliff overlooking Cullercoats Harbor, where he observed the comings and goings of fishing boats. Fishing Off Scarborough shows two young women and two fishermen in a coble as it slices through coastal waters. Carefully rendered in graphite, the figures and fishing boat stand in contrast to Homer’s spontaneous, abstract representation of clouds, mist, and spray done in opaque white watercolor. In addition to employing graphite to describe concrete objects, Homer used his pencil to suggest abstract effects, such as smoke rising from the steamship in the right background. Fishing Off Scarborough served as the basis for Homer’s 1883 watercolor, Returning Fishing Boats, which the artist completed after his return to New York from England.",2623.0,"Artist

"Mosaic Disk with a Mythological and Historical Scene, 1400/1500, Mixtec","Turquoise and shell mosaics were a specialty of the Mixtecs of northern Oaxaca, whose artists worked in the imperial Aztec (Mexica) capital, Tenochtitlan, after the mid-15th century. This disk commemorates historical events using calendrical and mythological imagery. In Mixtec culture, as elsewhere in ancient Mesoamerica, the history of the world was conceived in terms of cosmic cycles of creation, destruction, and re-creation. Each cycle, known as a “sun,” lasted many centuries. On a smaller scale within each cycle, time was organized into repeating 52-year periods whose end and renewal were marked by equinox sunsets and sunrises in rituals of transition.",2630.0,"Culture

"Questions, 1981/2003, Fischli & Weiss","Since 1979, the collaborative duo of Fischli & Weiss have imbued their art with a mix of absurdist humor, childlike wonder, existential inquiry, and an interest in the mundane. Their work—including books, films, mixed-media installations, photographs, sculptures, slide projections, and videos—incorporates aspects of Pop Art, Conceptual Art, and Dada yet defies association with any particular style. With a playful focus on the everyday, their art explores prosaic objects and experiences in a way that invests them with an unexpectedly sublime quality.
Questions, which combines profound metaphysical speculations and banal tribulations, exemplifies the willful ambiguity that pervades the artists’ oeuvre. A large-scale, choreographed installation, the work utilizes fifteen slide projectors to cast hundreds of handwritten queries written in four different languages—English, German, Italian, and Japanese—in white on the walls of a dark room. The words, never ceasing to ask while proposing no answers, overlap each other, creating undulating patterns that slowly appear and quickly fade. The interrogations range from the empirical (“How long is the Nile?”) to the absurd (“Is it true that traces of aliens have been found in yogurt?”), the personal (“Am I loved?”), and the metaphysical (“Do souls wander?”). “Our aim wasn’t to think about the questions themselves too much,” the artists explained, “but about someone coming up with all those questions. In very vague terms, we did imagine someone asking himself slightly paranoid questions that revolve very much around himself.” These, they think, are just the sort of questions that would run through his mind as he falls asleep, hence the dark room.
Questions have preoccupied Fischli & Weiss for over twenty-five years, first appearing in the photocopied publication Order and Cleanliness (1981), which accompanied the film The Least Resistance (1980–81). In that work, the artists, dressed in plush rat and bear costumes, ponder the limits of existence. They explored this terrain further in the book Big Questions/Small Questions, in which they juxtapose expansive questions such as “Where is the galaxy going?” with smaller ones like “Has the last bus gone?” The pair revisited these interrogations in 1984, when they lined the interior of Question Pot, a large polyurethane vessel, with one hundred questions in German. They first projected their queries in 2000 with three slide projectors, following this with a five-projector version and expanding it yet again with Questions, the large-scale work shown here. Along with a companion book, Will Happiness Find Me?, the piece debuted at the 2003 Venice Biennale, where it won the Golden Lion; soon thereafter, it entered the Art Institute’s collection as a joint acquisition with the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.
Within its dreamlike atmosphere, Questions highlights the force of language, illu-minating the concerns that haunt our psyches. Grand in scale and powerfully poignant, it evokes and transcends nearly every other work the artists have produced.",2638.0,"Artist

"Panels from the High Altar of the Charterhouse of Saint-Honoré, Thuison-les-Abbeville: Virgin and Child, 1490/1500, French School","This panel was once part of the altarpiece decorating the high altar of the Carthusian monastery at Thuison, outside of Abbeville in northern France. Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings. When the wings were open, the interior of the altarpiece told the story of Christ’s Passion and Resurrection through painted narratives on the inside of the wings and painted and gilded carvings in the central shrine whose central subject was undoubtedly the Crucifixion. The carvings have not survived. The fronts and backs of the wings were sawn apart in the mid 19th century; all the wing panels except one narrative (The Entry into Jerusalem, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg) are in the Art Institute.",2640.0,"Artist
