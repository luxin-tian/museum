"Christ Carrying the Cross, 1500/15, Hans Maler zu Schwaz","This narrow panel was probably part of a predella, the supporting lower portion of an altarpiece, which no doubt featured other scenes from the Passion of Christ. It is most likely an early work by Hans Maler, who worked in Ulm in southwestern Germany before settling in the Tyrol. He is now known chiefly for portraits painted in the later part of his career for members of the imperial family and other prominent sitters. His earlier religious paintings are a variant on the expressive, patterned style and vivid characterization of an accomplished group of painters working in Ulm and nearby Memmingen, notably Bartholomäus Zeitblom and Bernhard Strigel.",2652.0,"Artist

"The Annunciation, Completed by 1457, Johann Koerbecke","The Annunciation was one of eight scenes from the life of the Virgin decorating the inside of the wings of Johann Koerbecke’s masterpiece, the altarpiece formerly on the high altar of the Cistercian abbey of Marienfeld, near Münster in northwest Germany. The wings framed the altarpiece’s center, where relics and a gilded statue of the Virgin and Child were displayed when the altarpiece was opened on feast days. The gilded backgrounds and festive architecture of the wings enhanced the splendor of the open altarpiece. The backs of the moveable wings, decorated with more somber Passion subjects in naturalistic landscape settings, were visible when the altarpiece was closed. The ensemble was dismantled in the late 17th century, and the panels were dispersed in the early 19th century, after the wings had been sawn apart, separating the Passion scenes from those on the interior.",2653.0,"Artist

"The Mysteriously Abandoned New Home, 1958, H. C. Westermann","American printmaker and sculptor H. C. Westermann became known in the 1960s for playfully subversive works of art often made from found objects. The artist borrowed strategies from his Dadaist and Surrealist predecessors and created an oeuvre that defies stylistic definition and classification. This sculpture is characteristic of Westermann’s exceptional carpentry skills. When describing The Mysteriously Abandoned New Home, Westermann wrote of the large octagonal canopy over a merry-go-round at Chicago’s Riverview Amusement Park. The work is also reminiscent of the octagonal architectural forms that were popular in the United States in the 19th century.",2655.0,"Artist

"Commerce Counselor Ebenstein, 1908, Oskar Kokoschka","Despite its early date (Oskar Kokoschka described it as his second finished painting), this portrait already reveals the artist’s great gifts as a portraitist and the hallmarks of his highly personal form of Expressionism. Like Max Beckmann and Chaim Soutine, Kokoschka used calculated distortions of line and color in a highly individual manner to give emotional force to his paintings. As a student in Vienna, he was influenced not only by the German Expressionist artists of Die Briicke (The Bridge), but also by Gustav Klimt and by Jugendstijl art, as shown by the sensitive, nervous line and the touch of melancholy that came to characterize his work.
Kokoschka met his sitter through the avant-garde architect Adolf Loos, who introduced him to Vienna’s high society and thus provided him with subjects for a penetrating series of portraits. As tailor to the Austrian imperial court, Ernst Ebenstein was one of the most accomplished and admired members in the world of Viennese high fashion. During a visit to the Art Institute in 1958, Kokoschka remembered him as kind and generous. Ebenstein had offered to make the artist some clothes and had taught him a great deal about anatomy based on his sartorial experience as a perceptive observer of the human body. Kokoschka’s affection for his sitter seems to be reflected in the compassionate yet unflinching honesty with which he recorded the signs of age on his face and hands. The sitter has been caught in a moment of relaxed introspection, his gaze averted from the viewer, his social persona momentarily laid aside to reveal his inner self. Even the sitter’s impeccable black attire has a crumpled, weathered quality that bespeaks human vulnerability and frailty. As in other portraits by Kokoschka, the hands constitute a psychological focus as strong as that of the face. The artist’s expressive distortions are especially evident here. Painted in a vivid orange, these gnarled and bony hands seem to express the man’s very essence and become the locus of his professional and psychological identity.",2660.0,"Artist

"Rehearsal of the Pasdeloup Orchestra at the Cirque d’Hiver, c. 1879, John Singer Sargent","Free rehearsals of the classical concerts conducted by Jules-Étienne Pasdeloup were a popular event in late-19th-century Paris. John Singer Sargent attended the performances, drawing inspiration from the “odd picturesqueness”—as a fellow artist put it—of the steep view from the upper seats. This composition shows Sargent’s perceptive use of Impressionist techniques to depict modern, urban subjects. He employed thin, abbreviated brushstrokes to capture the rich atmosphere and graphic qualities of the amphitheater’s architecture, the musicians, their sheet music and instruments, and the circus performers gathered in the foreground.",2662.0,"Artist

Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings. When the wings were open, the interior of the altarpiece told the story of Christ’s Passion and Resurrection through painted narratives on the inside of the wings and painted and gilded carvings in the central shrine whose central subject was undoubtedly the Crucifixion. The carvings have not survived. The fronts and backs of the wings were sawn apart in the mid 19th century; all the wing panels except one narrative (The Entry into Jerusalem, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg) are in the Art Institute.",2666.0,"Artist

"Cubi VII, 1963, David Smith","David Smith was among the first American artists to master the use of steel and other industrial materials. After many years of working metal into evocative linear compositions, he forged a new, formal language for sculpture through increased focus on shape, volume, surface, and structure. Cubi VII is part of a series executed in the four years that preceded his untimely death in 1965; the twenty-eight sculptures are most known for their use of industrial stainless steel. While the spare, sleek forms of the Cubi series relate them to Minimalist sculpture of the 1960s, the works also reflect the artist’s connection to Abstract Expressionism in the gestural quality of their wire-brushed surfaces and their attendant emotive power. Its abstract qualities intact, Cubi VII also seems to allude to the human figure. Indeed, the large, central form and adjacent shapes evoke a torso with limbs. Yet when one walks around the sculpture, it becomes less a symbol of the human form than a vehicle for exploring the relationship between architectonic volumes and the space surrounding them. Despite its solidity, the piece appears to have no fixed center, and its elements seem precariously positioned, challenging accepted notions of balance. The reflective, burnished surfaces of Cubi VII pick up the shifting light of its outdoor site—the Art Institute’s north garden on Michigan Avenue.",2672.0,"Artist

"Bather/Night, 2009, Carroll Dunham","Carroll Dunham creates prints, drawings, and paintings featuring boldly graphic, often erotic cartoon-inspired imagery. His work appears at once sophisticated and childlike, refined and obscene. Bather/Night is part of a recent series that explores the somewhat well-worn art-historical theme of a woman in nature—a new subject for the artist. Specifically, this piece depicts a woman bathing, a theme that recalls classic depictions by Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, and Pierre Bonnard. Shown in severe foreshortening, a female nude bends forward under a night sky inspired by the painter Vincent van Gogh, splashing herself with water as her geisha-style hair blends into the background. As Dunham explained, ""It’s almost similar to the way you might simultaneously be having the most intimate look at someone’s body parts and out the other side of your eye you see a tree way off in the distance—that collision of subjects and that collision of space.""",2681.0,"Artist
