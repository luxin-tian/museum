"Still Life with Fruit and Wine Jug, 1874, Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli","Vincent van Gogh was a great admirer of Adolphe Monticelli’s richly impastoed paintings, and he saw in the older artist’s landscapes, flower arrangements, and portraits the sincere expression he was seeking for his own art. He also identified with the myth of the misunderstood artist from Provence that rapidly grew around Monticelli after his death in 1886. Indeed, the artist played a role in Van Gogh’s decision that same year to travel to the South of France, where he hoped to find the source of Monticelli’s light. In this still life, Monticelli’s brilliant yellow fruits anticipate Van Gogh’s celebrated lemon yellow suns.",2701.0,"Artist

"Saint Barbara, c. 1520, Jean Bellegambe","Jean Bellegambe worked in Douai, in a part of northern France that was once part of the county of Flanders. These panels are the wings of a triptych, a three-paneled folding altarpiece, whose center (now in the Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels) shows the Virgin and Child enthroned under an elaborate architectural canopy. The two elegant saints are identifiable by their attributes: for Catherine, the wheel upon which she was tortured and the sword with which she was martyred; and for Barbara, the tower where her father locked her up to keep her safe from suitors. Saint Catherine also holds a ring, which the Christ Child in the Brussels panel reaches to grasp, thus indicating that their mystical union was the subject of the triptych. The tops of the two wings have been rounded off to mask their original function as moveable shutters to the left and right of the center panel. The backs and fronts of the wings were also separated; the backs of the wings, showing the Annunciation when the triptych was closed, are now in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore.",2703.0,"Artist

Welsh suggested that this sheet was linked to a series of compositions Mondrian made around 1914, based on the facade of a church in the town of Domburg, the Netherlands. This drawing has appeared in an exhibition at The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1971, and was previously in the collections of artists Yves Tanguy (1900-1955) and Leon Kelly (born 1901). Nevertheless, 20th-century art-including works by Modigliani and Matisse, for example-has been a popular target of forgers, and Mondrian’s authorship of this drawing will continue to be the subject of disagreement.",2711.0,"Artist

"The Painter Otto Dix and His Wife, Martha, 1925/26, printed 1950/64, August Sander","August Sander, a professional portrait photographer based in Cologne, first exhibited his ambitious People of the 20th Century project in 1927. The final compilation, constituting (as Sander put it) a “physiognomical time exposure of German man,” was published posthumously and included over 600 portraits made between 1892 and 1954. Each sitter is featured at home or at work, dressed and posed according to their social identity. Sander categorized his subjects within a personally constructed social hierarchy, ranging from artists and farmers to beggars and the mentally ill. Otto Dix was a well-known painter whose work had led Sander to reassess his earlier portraiture and broaden its scope. This photograph appears in the section on women, alongside several portraits of artists and their wives; in contrast to the frontal poses usually found in his images of couples, in these Sander presented one spouse in profile.

"The Painter Otto Dix and His Wife, Martha, 1925/26, printed 1950/64, August Sander","The portraits of August Sander are notable for their directness and freedom from the stiff decorum common to studio portraiture of his day. After working for many years as an itinerant photographer, Sander developed a quasi-scientific project in the 1920s to catalogue representatives of German society. Influenced by the work of painters such as Otto Dix, his subject here, this venture led Sander to reassess his earlier portraits and broaden the scope of his portraiture. Launching his project in 1927, Sander described his aim “to see things as they are and not as they should or might be … to tell the truth about our age and people.” Dix, who had recently published The War, a portfolio of gruesome etchings, similarly aspired to a detached recording of momentous events: “I … had to see how someone next to me suddenly fell and was gone, the bullet hitting him right in the middle.”",2731.0,"Artist

"Relief, 1937, Charles Green Shaw","Relief exemplifies Charles Green Shaw’s conviction that a work of art did not require a subject to evoke an aesthetic response. Composed of a cascading arrangement of biomorphic forms, this striking wood construction conveys the compositional balance and rhythm that Shaw, an early member of the American Abstract Artists group, sought in his nonobjective works. Equally important, Relief is neither a painting nor a sculpture, but rather a hybrid of the two. The wood pieces enter the viewer’s space even as the work remains attached to the wall, the traditional realm of painting. Relief can therefore be seen as part of the ongoing modernist endeavor to challenge the two-dimensionality of the picture plane.",2732.0,"Artist

"Ladder to the Light, 1951, Wifredo Lam","This work seems to have had several variant titles: an early published reference to it gave the title in Spanish as Escala para una luz, with the English translation The Lights That Goes Up; in a letter of 1958, Lam referred to the painting in French as Eschelles pour une lumière (Ladders for a Light or Ladders for Illumination; letter of December 5, 1958, to Edwin Bergman); and Lam’s ""inventory sheet"" for the painting listed the title in both French and English as La Lumière qui monte and Ladde to the Light. All of these titles, together with some distinctive motifs in the painting, may refer not only to Afro-Cuban Santería beliefs, but also to the European mystical tradition of Ramon Llull (c. 1235-1316), Robert Fludd (1574-1637), and Jakob Böhme (1575-1624). The title Ladder to the Light, in particular, conveys the notion of rising stages toward enlightenment. The diagonal of the shaft that traverses the composition vertically reclls a leaning ladder, and the elongated white diamond on the right may allude to crossing beams of light, a shape that also appears in Fludd’s diagrams, created by crossing triangles of projection.",2735.0,"Artist

"Ladder to the Light, 1951, Wifredo Lam","These references to a Western tradition of initiation and enlightenment are here brilliantly absorbed into the dominant imagery based on Santería beliefs. Often highly abstract and ambiguous, these Santería-inspired elements are set dramatically against a ark, looselt painted background, haunted by ghostly, imprecise shapes. The diagonal shaft, which is also like a staff, may represent the ""lightening spear"" of Changó, the Yoruba god of thunder. It is crossed by horned and ax-headed spikes, which may also stand for the rungs of the ladder named in the picture’s title. The little round shapes on the shaft, suggesting schematic heads, may refer to Elegguá, an orisga (divinity or spirit who mediates between humans and nature) often present in Lam’s work. One of Elegguá’s roles, that of guardian of the roads, may be evoked by the brown horizontal strip that crosses the picture behinf the central shaft. The brown, angled form that juts across the upper-right portion of the canvas suggests the presence of a huge figure, whose elbow is represented supporting the shaft or spear. The pink, fleshy forms at the upper right and lower left may be versions of the horse-woman, a motif found frequently in Lam’s work. This horse-woman figure derives from the Santería notion that the worshiper is possessed by the orisha in a manner comparable to a horse mounted by it’s rider (see Julia P. Herzberg, ""Wifredo Lam,"" Latin American Art 2, 3 [Summer 1990], p. 20). The evidently sexual quality of the pink forms, however, hints at a more personal kind of illumination. There is the suggestion of a breast at the upper right and of buttocks or breasts at the left, forms that rhyme with the circular ""heads"" on the horizontal shaft and thus introduce a double reading of these round shapes.",2735.0,"Artist

The articulated marionette inside the box is suspended from a string extending out of a tiny hole in the top of the box. Pulling the string changes the marionette’s position, which may be secured using a tiny wood shim lodged in the hole.

"Untitled (Harlequin), 1935/38, Joseph Cornell","There is some disagreement about the identity of the Marionette; often described as Harlequin, because of its diamond costume, it also has the flounced collar and cone shaped hat of Pierrot, a clown, or a Punchinello figure. Harlequin is typically depicted wearing a black tricorn, The conflation of these two characters may derive from a jack-in-the-box toy. Cornell may also have intended some reference to the revival of commedia dell ‘arte imagery in the work of European artists like Pablo Picasso and Gino Severini during the 1920s, which was seen as part of a reaction against modernism and a return to a classical tradition. Although aware of this, Cornell is more likely, in a manner typical or his multi-layered references to art history and his personal memories, to have had in mind the stock figures of the Italian theater as they became part of popular tradition during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, from Watteau’s Gilles to the shadow-box theater.",2737.0,"Artist

"Vase Depicting a Phoenixlike Bird, 1700/50, Talavera Poblana","Chinese blue-and-white porcelain arrived in the Americas during the 1570s, when the Manila Galleons began crossing the Pacific Ocean from Mexico to the Spanish Philippines and back. Cargoes of Asian luxury goods landing at Acapulco were transshipped to Colonial Mexico City and Puebla, where they remained until shipment continued across the Atlantic Ocean to Seville. A thriving ceramic industry developed in Puebla, producing glazed earthenware imitating porcelain and freely adapting Chinese designs, often with humorous vitality. This vase of Chinese shape displays panels with phoenix-like birds framed by dot-and-leaf patterns, scrolled tendrils, and semicircular “Chinese asters” beneath a cloudlike canopy.

"Inasmuch As It Is Always Already Taking Place, 1990, Gary Hill","Gary Hill’s video installations investigate the complex relationship between language and images. In the 1970s, Hill experimented first with sound installations and then a video recorder. In the 1980s, alongside other video artists such as Bruce Nauman and Bill Viola, he began to focus on the technical capabilities of the medium rather than its aesthetic qualities, seeking to create a meditative space where he could explore issues of authorship, consciousness, and semiotics.
Like other works by Hill, Inasmuch As It Is Always Already Taking Place is an amalgam of visual, structural, and sound components. The piece consists of sixteen staggered, uncased monitors that display life-size male body parts, pages of a book being thumbed, and a page with text that is too small to read. Varying in size from one-quarter inch (an eyepiece of a video camera) to twenty-three inches (the size of a ribcage), the screens, with their exposed, nervelike wires, are recessed into a five-foot niche that is set below eye level. The fragmented figure’s subtle movements are juxtaposed with nearly inaudible speech, primitive sounds of groaning, smacking noises, finger tapping, rippling water, and gun shots. Moving in close enough to decipher the sound, the viewer hears intermittent statements including “It was only an idea” and “I couldn’t say it any other way,” as if the body has its own language.
Rooted in Poststructuralist theory, including the work of French philosopher Maurice Blanchot and others, Hill’s practice merges the visual and literary arts. As he has said, “My preoccupation with language began with very sculptural notions coming out of sound, the body, utterance and speaking.” In Inasmuch As It Is Always Already Taking Place, Hill adds a layer of language and deconstructs his own body, focusing on the scene as a whole rather than on each individual image. The dismembered body is decidedly self-referential, appearing as a random pile, or, as Hill put it, “a kind of debris.” Abstracted, it exudes a sensation of presence and absence, having become barely recognizable despite its close-up detail. On one level, Hill seems to be challenging a notion of masculine authority by revealing and fracturing an image of male nudity.
Unmoored from their usual spatial and temporal relationship to one another, these body parts are treated almost as a still life or landscape painting. Indeed, the work can be seen as a vanitas image; the visceral sounds and the barely moving, harshly lit figure are the only signs of life and thus serve as reminders of its transience—and perhaps also of the impermanent nature of electronic media. This disturbing and complex video installation suggests many dichotomies: being and knowing, self and other, private and public, reality and imagination.",2746.0,"Artist

Saint John the Evangelist was acquired by the Chicago collector Martin Ryerson in the 1890s; Mourning Virgin, recently identified as a fragment of the same work, was acquired in 2004. Technical examination showed traces of the cross and the head of Christ on both fragments and also provided evidence to connect them to another panel in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, depicting a saint and donor. These fragments were thus formerly part of an intensely emotional image of Christ’s road to Calvary, which would have formed the left half of a diptych, or portable folding altarpiece, with the representation of the donor in prayer on the right.",2747.0,"Artist

"Mold (Muffa), 1952, Alberto Burri","Alberto Burri began his career as an artist after returning to Italy in 1946 from Texas, where he had been held in a prisoner-of-war camp. Attracted to unconventional, humble materials—such as tar, sand, and enamel— and processes like collage, Burri made work that is related to the European Informel movement and the Art Brut of Jean Dubuffet and is seen as a precursor to Arte Povera. Using a restricted palette of red and black, Burri established a simplicity and directness in his abstract work. Mold, a mixed-media painting, is from a series in which he explored the use of pumice stone. Here the visceral impact of this gritty, highly porous substance exemplifies Burri’s pursuit of material reality without recourse to realism.",2748.0,"Artist
