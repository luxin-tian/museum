"Horse, 5th–6th century","This haniwa is a representation of a fully decorated horse, complete with saddle, stirrups, and bell ornaments on its front and back. The strap at the front has an incised chevron pattern, and the metal ring (suwari kanagu) used to gather up the leather straps at the back of a horse can be clearly seen. Excavated in Ibaragi prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, such a horse would have likely been at the front of a burial mound, in an area filled with a variety of figurines, as well as animal forms, perhaps meant to represent the possessions the deceased hoped to take with him after death. Horse breeds from the Asian continent proved to be effective militarily and quickly became symbols of wealth and power. Horses have also long been considered divine beings with special spiritual abilities.",2754.0,"Title

"Head of Pavlova, 1924, Malvina Hoffman","In 1910 the sculptor Malvina Hoffman saw the famed Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova perform in London, a
profound experience that ultimately led to their close friendship. Hoffman spent years capturing the exquisite
grace of Pavlova’s movement in different sculptures and reliefs, yet in Head of Pavlova she created a restrained, almost melancholic portrait of the dancer wearing an elaborate Russian headdress, her eyes nearly closed. Hoffman explained that in her portraits of Pavlova, her friend appears as a “rather sad, thoughtful person, far removed from the vivacious and exciting fairy that Pavlova represents over the footlights.”",2758.0,"Artist

"Extemporaneous, 1927, Helen Torr","Helen Torr and her husband, the painter Arthur Dove, enjoyed a richly artistic and supportive marriage as they both experimented with modernist art-making techniques. Extemporaneous is one of the most unusual works of Torr’s career, and it is striking for its irregular play of narrow bands of silvery gray, which exuberantly thrust into the corners of the composition. When Torr made Extemporaneous,she and her husband lived aboard a sailboat, and some part of its structure might well have informed this work. Certain elements recall shaped metal fittings, complete with small round circles that are reminiscent of rivets or nails. But the artist deliberately abstracted any recognizable motifs, leaving an eloquent exploration of pure form and color.",2760.0,"Artist

"The Watcher, Tynemouth, 1882, Winslow Homer","During his sojourn in England, from 1881 to 1882, Homer settled in the small fishing village of Cullercoats, located about two miles from the city of Tynemouth. He often drew and painted the women of the village, as they watched and waited on the shore, eyes always trained on the frequently treacherous sea. The Watcher, Tynemouth emphasizes the woman’s loneliness and anxiety as she faces the raw forces of nature. Homer chose to represent the woman with her back to the viewer. She is clad in dark blue and reddish-brown clothing, and her face is obscured by a headscarf, so as to shield her from probing eyes. The muted palette of this watercolor—overcast blue-gray sky, murky green and blue waves—exaggerates the stark whiteness of the foamy caps on the waves. Their peaks punctuate the horizon line, as do the sails of the two boats in the distance.",2767.0,"Artist

"Burden Basket, 1870/80, Pomo","Northern California is the ancestral home of numerous Indian tribes, many of which speak different languages yet share a similar culture and an artistic tradition centering on basketry. Basket making is an ancient art, and, in some indigenous traditions elsewhere in the Americas, the graphic character of early basketry designs deeply influenced subsequent ceramics, textiles, and other mediums of visual expression. In California, where the making of fine baskets always remained a primary art, women from the Karok, Maidu, Mono, Pomo, Washo, Wintu, Yokuts, and other tribes produced works unsurpassed in fineness of weave, subtle shape, and sophisticated design.
The Pomo were especially accomplished designers and weavers of baskets for all purposes, and the cone-shaped burden basket is a well-known form in their artistic repertoire. This example is in excellent condition considering both its age and the fact that it was subjected to practical use. (As an object made for utilitarian purposes, it has no sacred or ritualistic functions.) The subtly curving, conical shape is beautifully woven with a diagonal twine; alternating, triangular motifs in dark brown and light tan escalate in size from the narrowest, lower point to the wide, open rim. Serrated lines of uniformly smaller triangles separate the dominant shapes and reinforce the overall sense of spiraling, diagonal movement. This is a very old Pomo graphic convention, for such baskets were seen and described by Sir Francis Drake on his voyage of exploration up the California coast in 1577. In the Art Institute’s collection, there are other notable Pomo baskets of different shapes and functions but of similar graphic character: a large hemispherical bowl [1998.308]; an imposing wedding basket ornamented with quail feathers, shell, and colored glass beads [2000.323]; and a jewel-like ""gift basket"" covered with iridescent feathers [2003.173].
This particular basket, however, is an especially pleasing “classic” in the Pomo visual tradition, amplifying our understanding of a remarkable genre of American Indian art. It also provides an example of basketry’s last great flowering in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a sweeping vogue for collecting such works accompanied the international Arts and Crafts movement, which in the United States inspired a desire to create a deeply rooted ""American"" vocabulary of forms in architecture, painting, and sculpture.

The basket is beautifully woven with a diagonal twine; alternating triangular motifs in dark brown and light tan escalate in size rom the bottom to the rim. Serrated lines of smaller triangles separate the dominant shapes and reinforce the overall sense of spiraling, diagonal movement. Ancient basketry preceded ceramics and influenced many shapes and designs of later pottery.

"Summer (recto), 1913 (recto)1914 (verso), William Zorach","William Zorach may be better known for his wood and stone sculptures, but he began his career as a painter. This rare, early canvas shows Zorach’s love of organic forms of nature and his exuberant use of color—a direction he was encouraged to explore by his wife, the artist Marguerite Thompson Zorach. The four languid nudes in a pastoral setting create a splendid vision of the vie artistique, while the often nonnaturalistic hues draw attention to the abstracted, patterned surface. Summer also reveals the artist’s admiration for the work of Henri Matisse, which he would have seen in Paris and at the 1913 Armory Show.",2775.0,"Artist

"Head #3, 1973, Willem de Kooning","In 1969, during a vacation in Rome, Willem de Kooning was invited by the American sculptor Herzl Emanuel to his nearby bronze foundry. While there, de Kooning began working with clay and, over the course of the next couple of weeks, made a series of small-scale figures, one of which Emanuel cast in bronze. Encouraged by the sculptor Henry Moore, de Kooning continued creating works that he called “painting in three dimensions.” The heavy, exaggerated form of Head #3 recalls the contorted figures from de Kooning’s paintings. Reflecting on his sculptures, the artist stated: “In some ways, clay is even better than oil. You can work and work on a painting but you can’t start over again with the canvas like it was before you put the first stroke down… . But with clay … if I don’t like what I did, or I changed my mind, I can break it down and start over. It’s always fresh.”",2779.0,"Artist

"Fingal Mourning Over the Body of Malvina, from Ossian’s Berrathon, c. 1810, Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson","The dazzling, otherworldly, glow-in-the-dark effect Girodet achieved in this drawing is a testament to his extraordinary skill as a draftsman and painter, and to his all-consuming desire to be original.
Girodet illustrates a scene from a poem purportedly written by the ancient Scottish bard, Ossian, whose work was “discovered” and published in the 1760s. A famous literary hoax, the poems took Europe by storm. Here, Ossian’s father Fingal stands before the body of the dead Malvina, while her spirit ascends from the moonlit water behind him.

"Divers on a Yellow Background, 1941, Fernand Léger","Long committed to ideals of social equality, Fernand Léger sought, especially during the latter part of his career, to reconcile modern art with the demands of a mass audience. Beginning in the mid-1930s, the artist executed many monumental works and turned with increasing frequency to the motif of the human figure, using organic forms inspired by the natural world rather than the geometric shapes of the man-made, machine-oriented one. Inspired by his memory of swimmers diving off the docks in Marseilles, Divers on a Yellow Background is one of numerous drawings and paintings on this theme that the artist realized while residing in the United States during World War II.",2794.0,"Artist

Though Dürer left them unsigned, possibly because he borrowed their source material, he referred in his diary to giving away his series of knots on a trip to the Netherlands, and this title has become standard.
