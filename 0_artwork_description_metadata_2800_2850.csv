"Seated Figure, 1917, Jacques Lipchitz","Beginning in 1900, young painters and sculptors of all nationalities migrated to the Paris neighborhood of Montparnasse, the city’s hub of avant-garde activity. Despite their different approaches and interests, the artists of the so-called School of Paris fostered an inspiring climate of imaginative cross-fertilization that helped to sustain the idea of Paris as the center of artistic activity until the beginning of World War II. Jacques Lipchitz moved to Paris in 1909, and through his friendships with Diego Rivera, Pablo Picasso, and others, he participated in the Cubist movement. His bas-reliefs and sculptures in the round communicate the geometric and fractured forms and the favored subject matter (musicians and seated bathers, for example) of contemporary Cubist paintings.",2802.0,"Artist

"Austrian Tyrol, 1910, John Marin","In the summer of 1910, Marin spent six weeks in the Austrian Alps. The subject of his second solo exhibition at 291 in February 1911, his fluid and vividly colored Tyrolean watercolors mark a breakthrough in his artistic practice. For the first time, the artist worked with little or no graphite underdrawing, painting his most freely worked watercolors to date and communicating his feeling of energy and joy in the environment. Here Marin applied bright, transparent washes with rapid gestures and plenty of water, emphasizing the contour of a hill with an outline of bright yellow pigment that would become one of his trademarks. He improvised with subtraction as well, removing pigment from the center of the composition and allowing pale mists of color to obscure the mountains.",2806.0,"Artist

Belley fought in the American War of Independence and served as a captain in the French army during the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804) fighting to abolish slavery on the island of Saint-Domingue (now Hispaniola).

"Mist Rising at Sunset in the Catskills, c. 1861, Sanford Robinson Gifford","Sanford Robinson Gifford was a key figure of the Hudson River School, the group of landscape painters that flourished in the New York region in the mid-19th century. The Catskill Mountains were an important subject for Gifford, who made drawings and oil sketches like this one during excursions in the area; such works often served as source material for larger compositions produced later in his studio. Mist Rising at Sunset in the Catskills is a swift, freely rendered depiction of evanescent mist above a pond and brilliantly illuminated clouds amid a low sun.

"Return to Reason (Retour a la Raison), 1923, Man Ray (Emmanuel Radnitzky)","In the 1923 silent short of the same title, Man Ray filmed barely discernible scenes of Paris at night along with his own enigmatic photograms and conglomerations of spiraling or gyrating objects. The resulting sequence of near-total abstractions seems devoid of sense or purpose. The ""return to reason"" in the film comes finally in the form of a woman’s torso—modeled by cabaret personality Kiki de Montparnasse—turning to and fro beside a rain-covered windowpane. Man Ray reproduced the seductive finale, as well as other moments from the film, as photographs, singly and in strips. A still from Man Ray’s film, this particular photograph appeared on its own in the first issue of the key avant-garde journal La Révolution surréaliste, in 1924.",2817.0,"Artist

"Skyline with Boats in Foreground, 1910, John Marin","Sketched from the deck of the ferry that carried him back and forth from New Jersey to Manhattan, this view inspired Marin to improvise with his watercolors. For example, he explored a novel, indirect means of outlining the top of the Singer Building, painting a round blue stroke and, before the wash dried, touching his rag or blotting paper to its center and wicking out the wet color, leaving only the outline behind. He also floated one wet hue into another on the lightweight sketchbook sheet, allowing soft, feathered patterns to emerge as the colored strokes collided and dispersed.",2819.0,"Artist

One of Bolotowsky’s early works, this study for a 1939 mural that was later destroyed shows his intent to create an ideal, balanced composition devoid of a dominant form. Strongly influenced by Joan Miró and later by Piet Mondrian, Bolotowsky sought to achieve compositional harmony in his works. Perhaps in response to the turmoil of the 1930s, American abstract artists looked to nonobjective art as a way to attain a sense of stability and equilibrium.",2827.0,"Artist

In this half-length portrait, the painter depicted Marion Deering seated with her right arm resting on a chairback, her eyes engaging the viewer. Sargent rendered her face and hand with a high degree of finish, skills he had fine-tuned in the 1870s while a student in Paris. The broader handling of paint in her dress and its lace embellishments signals Sargent’s facility with the tactile and expressive possibilities of paint. Indeed, in the mid-1880s, Sargent not only worked in portraiture, but also experimented with the themes and vocabularies of Impressionism.",2833.0,"Artist

"Georgia O’Keeffe, 1918, Alfred Stieglitz","When Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O’Keeffe met, in 1915, he was a celebrated photographer who promoted modern art through his publications and galleries and she, 23 years his junior, was just beginning to gain recognition as a painter. A few years later they entered into a passionate affair, and they eventually married in 1924. Stieglitz felt revitalized by the relationship, and in a growing fascination with seriality he produced over 300 photographs of O’Keeffe to form a kind of composite portrait: in front of her paintings, in isolated fragments, and in the intimate poses of a paramour, as seen here. In 1921 Stieglitz exhibited a print of this image at the Anderson Galleries in New York, in a one-person show that included some 40 portraits of O’Keeffe. Years later, when O’Keeffe looked back at the pictures, she remarked, “It is as if in my one life I have lived many lives.”",2836.0,"Artist
