"Untitled (Hôtel de la Duchesse-Anne), 1957, Joseph Cornell","This box has formal similarities to Yellow Chamber in its use of white panels and in its balance between asymmetry and regularity. It also includes similar components: the bird, the metal springs, the ring, and the metal rod. But the idea of travel is more strongly evoked here, not least through the contrast between the white interior of the box and the tiny, brilliantly colored stamps, which are colorful and exotic in both a metaphoric and literal sense. The contrast between their small scale and the expanse of whiteness also suggests geographic distance. The idea of the box as a surrogate for travel is indeed very present here. Some of the openings in the white lattice at the right contain bingo chips, which conjure ocean voyages where deck games and gambling played a large part in the entertainment provided on board. Other lattice openings contain wood blocks with constellations on a blue background, which similarly recall navigation. The parrot contributes to the exotic atmosphere and introduces an element of tension, as it suggests both the freedom of travel and a bird caged or trapped. A coiled spring curls over the bird’s head to form a target like shape, while the bird itself seems to eye the butterfly and beetles on the stamps as if they might become its lunch.",2850.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Hôtel de la Duchesse-Anne), 1957, Joseph Cornell","The names of two hotels are included in this box: the Hotel des Voyageurs in Brest, a port in Brittany, and the Hotel dc la Duchesse-Anne in Nantes. The latter may have appealed to Cornell because of its association with the Surrealists: Andre Breton had spent part of World War I in Nantes, where he met Jacques Vache, whose anarchic humor had a strong influence on him. The name Anne also recalls one of Cornell’s favorite heroines, Thomas De Quincey’s Ann (see Ann—in Memory).",2850.0,"Artist

"The Solemn Pledge, Taos Indians, 1916, Walter Ufer","In The Solemn Pledge, Walter Ufer portrayed three generations of Native Americans, combining a bright, saturated palette with sensitively modeled figures. The white robes worn by the boy and two of the men suggest that the group is considering pledging the boy to kiva instruction, a Pueblo tradition of education in ceremonial practices, history, and language. The painting’s subject alludes to the necessary deliberation among early 20th-century Native communities about holding fast to traditions amid governmental assimilation efforts, an issue with ongoing relevance. Ufer, who trained at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and in Munich, was an active member by 1917 of the Taos Society of Artists, a group of white artists dedicated to painting the region’s people and landscape.",2863.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Crystal Cage), c. 1953, Joseph Cornell","The grid of this austere box is compellingly architectural, as is often the case with Cornell‘s boxes of the 1950s (see, for example, Dovecote). The interior is painted white and cracked as if with age, and the rear wall is entirely covered with a mirror. The effect of the reflections in the mirror behind is to suggest a scale and depth greater than in actuality. The torn remnants of painted paper around the edges of the twenty compartments resemble the white paint applied to new shop windows, or even the frosting of shop windows at Christmas. This casual or decorative effect contrasts with the geometric complexity of the box. The rather elegant frame, which has miter joints instead of the butt joints of many other boxes, also works against the miniature architectural effect, enclosing it like a picture.",2864.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Crystal Cage), c. 1953, Joseph Cornell","In spite of the similarity in structure with Nouveaux Contes de fees, there is no suggestion here of stacks or shelves to house and order things; whereas that box suggests a wealth of treasures within, hidden from sight, this is bleak and empty. The mirror, however, reflects the viewer, and recalls Cornell‘s fascination with the ambiguity of shop windows, which reflect the window gazer and confuse inside and out side.",2864.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Crystal Cage), c. 1953, Joseph Cornell","The letters WiNd, followed by a period, are roughly lettered on the inner side of the glass. They recall the use of lettering in Georges Braque’s and Pablo Picasso‘s Cubist paintings, which simultaneously emphasized the work’s surface and gave an often ambiguous clue to its subject. As in Cubist lettering, where journal was often shortened to jour, this word could be a truncated allusion to “window,” as well as a reference to the “wind” blowing outside.",2864.0,"Artist

"The Horses of Anahita, Modeled 1848/50, cast 1882/1910, William Morris Hunt","The 19th century was marked by a general fascination with exotic lands, their literature, and mythology. In 1846, after reading his brother’s translation of a sixth-century Persian poem about Anahita, the goddess of the night, William Morris Hunt became intrigued with the myth, and he returned to the subject repeatedly throughout his career. Anahita was an important Persian nature deity, probably derived from Babylonian mythology, who was identified with Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. Although the poem describes Anahita fleeing the dawn in her chariot, Hunt did not actually include the deity in this relief. He probably created the relief as a study for his murals in the New York State Capitol, in Albany. The expressive sculpting of the figures—with the horses’ legs modeled fully in the round—captures the drama of the moment in three dimensions.",2867.0,"Artist

"Lisa Lyon, 1981, Robert Mapplethorpe","Robert Mapplethorpe produced a body of work ranging from sensual floral still lifes and celebrity portraiture to explicit images of sadomasochism. Yet even his erotic male nudes evoke a classical aesthetic, balancing contemporaneity against timeless form. In 1980 Mapplethorpe met Lisa Lyon, who won the first World Women’s Bodybuilding Championship. Attracted to her muscular physique, which reminded him of Michelangelo’s rendering of the female figure, Mapplethorpe began a collaboration with her that culminated in the 1983 book Lady, Lisa Lyon. Depicting Lyon in nude, full-body portraits as well as a variety of character roles—society woman, dominatrix, mystic—this series celebrates ideals of female beauty from Antiquity and the Renaissance while simultaneously challenging stereotypical femininity today. Here, the framing of one flexed arm and a single breast suggests a double allegory of strength and sensuality.",2869.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov, 1913, Aleksei Alekseevich Morgunov","Aleksei Morgunov became familiar with the work of French and German artists during his 1909–10 travels in Europe. Unlike fellow avant-garde Russian artists Nathalija Gontcharova and Mihajl Larionov, who increasingly incorporated native folk art into their work, Morgunov preferred to follow outside artistic influences after he returned home. This painting references Édouard Manet’s 1882 A Bar at the Folies-Bergére (Courtauld Institute of Art Gallery, London) and announces Morgunov’s allegiance to the wider heritage of European modern art. In place of Manet’s iconic barmaid and patron, Morgunov substituted portraits of Gontcharova and Larionov.",2894.0,"Artist
