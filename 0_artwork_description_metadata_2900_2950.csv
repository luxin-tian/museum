"La Presa, 1952, Elizabeth Catlett","This print, La presa (The Dam), is representative of work Elizabeth Catlett produced for the Taller de Gráfica Popular (People’s Graphic Arts Workshop) to celebrate Mexicanidad (Mexican revolutionary spirit) and social and economic progress. This specific print is part of a series created to laud the achievements of Lázaro Cárdenas’s presidency: in this case, building a dam and channeling environmental resources into impoverished areas of the country, spreading electricity and improved education throughout Mexico. The print was produced for a government-sponsored conference and was exhibited there.",2905.0,"Artist

"Dance Staff, Late 19th/early 20th century, Baule","Two distinct sculptural forms appear in this unusual Baule carving, which may have been used during dance performances. Similar miniature renderings of animal-shaped helmet masks often decorate weavers’ pulleys. The twisted stem, on the other hand, is typically seen on the mallets used by diviners to strike an iron gong and initiate a trance. The combination of these types both demonstrates the maker’s skills and attests to the owner’s refined taste.",2906.0,"Culture

"At the Hippodrome, 1915, Gifford Beal","Gifford Beal depicted life’s exuberant side, focusing on festive places such as the circus, where many people spent their leisure time. Here performers rehearse and a stage crew prepares the set for the evening show. Beal portrayed a group of clowns in the foreground, at least two of whom wear white face paint, while a third appears to be in black face, evidence of the racist stereotyping that permeated American culture. Together the vivid colors of the uniforms, the exaggerated stances of the horses and the trombone player, and the dramatic stage lights convey the circus’s popular pageantry. The empty seats and trapeze bars suggest the excitement to come, when spectators and acrobats fill the theater.",2908.0,"Artist

"Flamborough Head, England, 1882, Winslow Homer","Flamborough Head, England shows Maggie Storey, one of Homer’s favorite models, standing resolutely upon the high chalk cliffs of Flamborough. Bearing the burden of a large basket and with her hands firmly on her hips, she is every bit the strong fisherwoman, the artist’s most frequent subject during his English sojourn of 1881-82. Homer positions the viewer slightly below Storey, giving her an even nobler, more monumental presence. The greater solidity and refinement of Homer’s figure drawing style was due at least in part to his study of Old Master drawings at the British Museum.",2911.0,"Artist

"Flamborough Head, England, 1882, Winslow Homer","This drawing demonstrates a shift in the way that Homer used opaque white watercolor. No longer reserving it for discrete highlights, he adopted the English practice of diluting opaque white watercolor to portray mist, clouds, and the “effects of distance and atmosphere” (Cohn 1977, p. 51). The artist applied this media in broad, expressive strokes, ending them in curves to indicate wispy clouds and varying the opacity to suggest different densities. He employed a dilute wash in the lower portion of the sky, dragging the side of his brush to create a hard edge that defined the horizon.",2911.0,"Artist

"Wall Painting with Stripes, 1944, Robert Motherwell","Of all the New York School painters, scholar and artist Robert Motherwell aligned himself most closely with modern European art and literature. An early painting by Motherwell, Wall Painting with Stripes fuses the geometric rigor found in the art of Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, and Pablo Picasso with an organic or biomorphic abstract language that is reminiscent of the imagery employed by Surrealists Max Ernst and Joan Miró. Although signed and dated 1944, this painting shows signs of having been altered over time by the artist. Pentimenti (evidence of previous compositions), including a complex network of lines that were simplified into egg-shaped forms and bulging curves, are visible underneath the vertical bands of ocher and white paint. Motherwell once wrote, “My pictures have layers of mistakes buried in them—an X-ray would disclose crimes—layers of consciousness, of willing.”",2913.0,"Artist

"Stranger in the Village #13, 1998, Glenn Ligon","Glenn Ligon is best known for text-based paintings that engage themes of authorship, history, and identity. Borrowing from writers such as Ralph Ellison and Zora Neale Hurston, Ligon systematically stencils quotations across his canvases. Stranger in the Village #13 is part of a series that the artist began in 1997, in which he rendered passages from James Baldwin’s 1953 essay of the same title in nearly illegible black paint. In response to Baldwin’s experience as an African American living in a remote village in Switzerland, Ligon commented, ""The gravity and weight and panoramic nature of that work inspired me … and the addition of the coal dust seemed to me to do that because it literally bulked up the text."" Allowing the words to degrade as part of his process, Ligon incorporated Baldwin’s meditations on colonialism, race, and national identity while addressing language’s inability to fully articulate experience.",2920.0,"Artist

"Christ on the Cross with Mary Magdalene, 1640/50, Follower of Simon Vouet","This small painting showing the grief-stricken Saint Mary Magdalene alone at the foot of the cross was probably intended as a private devotional work. The same expressive figure of Magdalene appears in more complex treatments of the Crucifixion and the Lamentation by followers of Simon Vouet. Having worked in Rome before returning to Paris as first painter to Louis XIII in 1627, Vouet was a gifted teacher, attracting many students and collaborators to his Paris workshop. Vouet’s followers Charles Poërson, Michel Dorigny, and François Perrier have all suggested as the author of this painting. Though the artist remains unidentified, his debt to Vouet’s weighty figure types, active draper, and rich colors is clear.",2926.0,"Artist

"Head of a Negro Woman, c. 1935, Sargent Claude Johnson","In Head of a Negro Woman, Sargent Claude Johnson combined abstract elements drawn from African sculpture and masks—such as the regularly scored marks that describe hair—with a naturalistic portrayal of the woman’s physiognomy. In the 1920s and 1930s, writer and philosopher Alain Locke urged artists to seek aesthetic inspiration from African art, and Johnson frequently followed this advice. Here, by subtly stylizing the woman’s appearance, Johnson made this delicate terracotta sculpture highly individual yet also timeless and universal.",2931.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Blue Sand Box), early 1950s, Joseph Cornell","This box is, like others of its type, designed to be handled; the sand, the metal ring, and the ball scattering into different formations like iron filings or a kaleidoscope. The inside of the box is painted white on all sides; a fine network of cracks suggests that it was artificially aged. As noted in the above media description, sixteen faint lines are etched into the bottom (or rear wall) of the box, radiating from a common center, and resulting in raised lines of white paint on either side of the incisions. An oval form was etched, using the same technique, in the upper right corner. The blue sand forms patterns when shaken that are determined by the raised lines. The three different mobile elements—ring, ball, and sand—make very different sounds as the box is shaken.",2937.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Blue Sand Box), early 1950s, Joseph Cornell","Cornell mentioned “sand boxes” as early as 1945 in his diary jottings. Significantly, in an entry of October 8, 1945, he referred to two different kinds of objects that are possible sources for these boxes: the “sailor’s box” and the “sand box as discovered in shop—birdhouse that might have [been] tended by her hands” (Cornell 1993, pp. 125–26). It is not entirely evident what he meant by the latter, but the link with the “birdhouse” suggests the sand tray that is customarily placed on the bottom of a bird‘s cage. The sailor’s box was an object of deep resonance for Cornell, with its references to voyages, exotic birds and butterflies, navigation, and treasured keepsakes in general. In a diary note of April 4, 1943, Cornell described an “Exhibition of miscellaneous objects found in trunks of sailors… shells, toy snake, wales [sic] tooth, beads (exotic), a butterfly box” (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1058; originally cited in New York 1980–82, pp. 33–34). The Sand Boxes are perhaps like some such treasure salvaged from the bottom of the sea.",2937.0,"Artist
