"Saint George, 1469/82, Martin Schongauer","Schongauer depicted Saint George in two formats: rectangular (below) and circular. The compositions differed dramatically. For the rectangular print, the saint bears down on top of the beast from the left, as the princess waits on the hill above for deliverance. In the more intimate roundel, George has already wounded his prey. Reeling backward into the curve of the circular plate mark, the dragon clasps the broken end of the lance as if it were an engraver’s burin.",2952.0,"Artist

"Field Armor, 1510/70","Skillfully forged of steel, this composite armor achieves its beauty with the simple elegance of its austere lines and form rather than its surface decoration. The armor was expertly crafted for protection: the smooth, rounded shape, breastplate, and heavy roping (turned edge etched with lines) at the upper edge of the breastplate functioned to deflect sword thrusts and glancing blows. Thick roping on the gauntlet knuckles acted as added protection. The helmet, with its smooth, rounded form, was shaped to deflect downward blows away from the head. The bracket attached to the right breastplate is called the lance rest, a shock-absorbing support designed to hold the lance when it was couched under the right armpit.",2958.0,"Title

"Ginny with the Yellow Hat, 1971, Alice Neel","Alice Neel’s evocative, subversive, and psychologically driven portraits have gained increasing recognition after her death. She brought a loquacious expressionism to each of her subjects—a diverse group of artists, intellectuals, and political leaders of the national Communist Party, as well as family and neighbors in Spanish Harlem. This portrait’s subject is the artist’s daughter-in-law, Ginny Neel, who was painted here at the age of twenty-seven. She sits nervously for the artist, her long, bony fingers and hunched shoulders embody a tense nervousness, and her cloche and winter coat imply that she was stopped on her way in. Neel had spent the previous winter in California with her son Hartley and Ginny, who were gifted the portrait upon its completion.",2961.0,"Artist

"Black and White, 1947, Ad Reinhardt","Ad Reinhardt’s work bridges the period between the Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s and the Minimal
and Conceptual Art movements of the following decade. Black and White bears witness to his understanding of Expressionist ideas concerning the materiality of paint, which he applied here in thin washes and thick impasto. The artist eventually abandoned all aspects of gestural abstraction in favor of solid fields of color arranged in rigid geometric patterns of squares and rectangles. This painting prefigures Reinhardt’s later
highly structured, reduced work, while still revealing ties with artists such as Franz Kline and Jackson
Pollock. It articulates his subtle sense of color, which he came to define in its purest sense as multiple possibilities of black. Reinhardt once said, “There is no such thing as emptiness or invisibility or silence.” His career was a pursuit of this belief.",2963.0,"Artist

In his abstracted earthenware decoration, Poor made use of his skills as a draftsman, emphasizing the simplified forms of Modernism to which he was drawn.

The stripes of white, black-brown, and red reflect the continued use of pattern elements typical of earlier blankets.

"Equestrian Portrait of the Emperor Maximilian I, 1508, Hans Burgkmair, the elder","This unique woodcut is printed in black and powdered gold inks on vellum. It may be the most opulent result of the Emperor Maximilian’s competition with Elector Frederick the Wise of Saxony and his court artist, Lucas Cranach. That contest produced an early form of chiaroscuro printing, a technique using black line blocks and colored tone or blocks for lighting effects. Indeed, as the only known impression of the Equestrian Portrait printed in black and gold on vellum, the Chicago print may well be the dedication impression sent to Frederick.",2973.0,"Artist

Painted on canvas over an unusually thick frame, strips of cadmium red and silver gray thrust outward toward the viewer, dismantling the boundary between painting and sculpture.

"Queer Basher/Icarus Falling, 1986, David Wojnarowicz","David Wojnarowicz was identified by The New York Times critic, Michael Kimmelman, in 1992 as ""one of the most influential artists of the 1980s."" Wojnarowicz first emerged in the context of the brash and brief burst of energy that took place in New York’s East Village in the beginning of the 1980s. Fusing the aesthetics of the punk-music scene, a keen awareness of an ethnically diverse street culture, and a committed sense of political activism, Wojnarowicz’s earliest works were often informal and ephemeral. The 1980s East Village scene in which Wojnarowicz thrived produced a number of artists who went on to broader recognition, including Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf, Jenny Holzer, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. His paintings, photographs, installations, performances, and experimental films are distinguished by raw expressions of rage and personal longing. Wojnarowicz’s work, most often concerned with the inequities and disenfranchisement of living with HIV and AIDS, ranged from the intentionally shrill to the elegiac. A gifted writer, the poignant beauty of his vision is perhaps best glimpsed through his published journal excerpts, short stories, and autobiographical essays. Indeed, the artist is now widely recognized for the strength of his artistic expression both in the visual arts and with the written word. The artist died of AIDS in 1992 at the age of thirty-eight.",2982.0,"Artist

"Hysteria, 1997, Sam Taylor-Wood","Sam Taylor-Wood rose to prominence in the 1990s for her psychologically sensitive films, photographs, and videos. In many of her works, she presents small moments of human drama that function as portraits of individual personalities, passions, and obsessions. The artist has stated, “I am trying to gather a complete series of human feelings, even if reflected in more than one person. The same room is the setting for eroticism, rage, pensiveness, creativity, repulsion, anxiety, joy, anguish, pleasure. It is as if I wanted to explain the entire range of the emotional or existential world.” The workings of emotion are far from simple, though, and as Taylor-Wood depicts ritualized expressions and intense outbursts in works like Hysteria, she explores the possible disjunctions between outward behavior and an internal sense of self.
The title Hysteria refers to an extreme state of emotional disturbance while recalling the now-discredited notion of female hysteria, a common diagnosis during the Victorian era for women experiencing any number of symptoms. The eight-minute video is a closely framed view of a woman’s face that challenges us to distinguish whether she is laughing or crying. The footage is presented in slow motion and without sound, heightening the confusion between these different emotions. In narrative cinema, close-ups conventionally elicit a feeling of intimacy with the characters, but Taylor-Wood’s ambiguous depiction of the woman’s silenced cries encourages varied responses—from conflicting senses of identification and alienation to different shades of emotional engagement and critical detachment.",2988.0,"Artist

"Seventeenth-Century Interior, 1877, Charles Gifford Dyer","Chicagoan Charles Gifford Dyer studied painting in Paris and Munich. The objects depicted in this canvas, such as the Chinese blue-and-white vase and Oushak Turkish lotto rug, were likely collected during his extensive travels and represent the tastes of a worldly, wealthy man. The painting recalls 17th-century Dutch compositions in its focus on surfaces, textures, and illusionism. Like moralistic Dutch still life paintings, it evokes the fleetingness of life (vanitas) by juxtaposing objects that quickly decay, such as fruit and flowers, with the enduring arts of literature and music. The crisscross pattern of the parquet floor and the draped rug create spatial depth, offering a portrait of the Gilded Age, a time when an expanding economy encouraged the rich to collect such treasures.",2989.0,"Artist

"Polycrates and the Fisherman, c. 1664, Salvator Rosa","Salvator Rosa developed a kind of dramatic landscape in which nature is presented as wild, dangerous, and filled with striking effects of light, broken trees, jagged cliffs, and dark grottoes. A native of Naples, Rosa settled in Rome in 1649, producing dramatic works that are regarded as counter-parts to the calm, classical landscapes of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. Rosa’s dark style is well suited to the subject of this pair of paintings; they recount an episode from the Greco-Persian Wars as told by the ancient Green historian Herodotus. The ruler of the island of Samos, Polycrates, had been blessed with remarkable good fortune. In an effort to ward off a reversal of fortune, he cast a precious ring into the sea, but it was returned to him, swallowed by a fish. His good fortune came to an end, however, when he was entrapped by Oroetus of Sardis and put to death.",2990.0,"Artist

"Le Geant, Champ de Mars, October 18, 1863, probably printed 1880/89, Nadar (Gaspard Félix Tournachon)","During the reign of Napoleon III (1852–70), Nadar cultivated an illustrious career as a writer, caricaturist, and, most notably, photographer, producing arresting portraits of his renowned friends and contemporaries. He was also an enthusiastic balloonist, an obsession that led him to construct the largest hot air balloon the world had seen and make the first aerial photographs in 1858. Viewing the Earth’s surface from above, he wrote, ""reduces all things to their relative proportions—to the Truth."" Nadar’s first flight aboard his balloon Géant (Giant) on October 4, 1863, was a great success. On the second launch, however, the balloon eventually crashed in Hanover, leaving Nadar with a fractured leg. This photograph of that launch establishes the sheer size of the balloon—which was made with 20,000 meters of silk and carried 80 passengers in a two-story basket—by juxtaposing it with the crowd of 200,000 who have come to watch it.",2995.0,"Artist
