"Woman with Hair in a Bun, c. 1930, Julio González","A pioneer of welded iron sculpture, Julio González initially worked in his native Barcelona as a metalsmith and later pursued a career in painting in Paris. It was there that he came to know Pablo Picasso, with whom he eventually embarked on a group of landmark metal sculptures. This work is one of approximately 30 heads that González fabricated during the first, and most experimental, phase of his evolution as a sculptor. It presents a traditional subject—the head of a woman—executed in a modernist style and industrial technique. Rather than carving a stone or wood block, or modeling with clay or plaster, González welded together pieces of iron cut into geometric shapes to indicate a woman’s features.",3002.0,"Artist

"Beaker (Humpen) with the Ages of Man, c. 1600","Enameled glass, decorated by painting and firing colored powders onto the surface, was common in German countries during this period. Decorations included coats of arms and symbols of guild affiliations; biblical tales; and illustrations of folk wisdom, hunting, and politics. This Humpen represents a particularly favored theme, the Ages of Man, but in contrast to Shakespeare’s contemporary description of the Seven Ages allotted to man in As You Like It, it optimistically depicts a hundred-year span in ten stages. The child playing with a hoop becomes the twenty-year old dandy, who in turn matures into the warlike thirty-year-old. A symbolic animal accompanies each decade of life; so a lion prowls beside the forty-year-old man in his prime. This amusing depiction of life’s cycle ends with the skeletal form of Death dragging the tottering hundred-year-old off the world stage, tempering the hilarity of drink with a reminder of the impermanence of life.",3003.0,"Title

"Interior, called “The Skaters”, c. 1655, Cornelis Visscher","Throughout his career, the Dutch painter Adriaen van Ostade depicted rustic genre scenes of peasants enjoying village pleasures; these had a major influence on the subject matter of Dutch art both during and after the 17th century. Cornelis Visscher’s work echoes the liveliness and warmth of Van Ostade’s, showing a merry group of peasants gathering in an interior to talk and enjoy a smoke. The small pair of skates on the floor in the center of the foreground indicates that the group may have returned from an afternoon of ice-skating, a popular leisure activity during the period.",3008.0,"Artist

"Sogyo Hachiman, 10th century","The literal meaning of the title of this statue is “Hachiman in the guise of a monk.” The cult of the Shinto deity Hachiman originated at Usa in northeast Kyushu, a site relatively close to the Korean peninsula and also a prominent early Buddhist center. This cult was distinct in its willingness to blend and assimilate a variety of more parochial beliefs. Its comfortable accommodation with Buddhism probably accounts for the deity’s form here: the image of the monk was perhaps the most familiar manifestation of the new religion, introduced into Japan in the sixth century.",3014.0,"Title

This panel represents Catherine Benincasa of Siena (1347–1380), who was one of the major religious figures and most influential women of the late Middle Ages. Affiliated with the Dominican order, she was renowned for her devotion to the poor and sick, as well as for her mystical visions. In one such vision, she saw herself marked with Christ’s wounds from his crucifixion, known as the stigmata. These marks are faintly visible on the backs of her hands in the present work and serve to identify her.",3019.0,"Artist

"Knight, Death, and the Devil, 1513, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer’s masterful engraving encourages the viewer to reflect on the inevitability of their mortality. Lurking behind the knight on his muscular warhorse, the skeletal, deteriorating figure of Death sits astride his aging steed and demonstrates the running hourglass of Time. The juxtaposition of the knight and Death suggests the knight’s impending demise. Despite this Christian soldier’s battle-ready appearance, no amount of armor can protect him (and, by proxy, the rest of humanity) from death, though he shows no outward signs of fear or of temptation by the devil, who follows closely behind.",3028.0,"Artist

"Angry Young Machine, 1959, H. C. Westermann","H. C. Westermann, who lived and worked in Chicago between 1947 and 1961, was a skilled woodworker known for sculptures that masquerade as uncanny yet playful versions of vernacular objects. Utilizing assemblages of commercial materials and found objects, the artist’s technically sophisticated, influential sculptures address recurring themes such as war, technology, and science fiction. Angry Young Machine was created after the artist viewed films based on John Osborne’s plays; the author was an influential member of the “Angry Young Men,” an antiestablishment group of English writers in the 1950s. Galvanized plumbing pipes and fixtures, a small skyscraper, a tiny toy soldier guarding an ornamental bridge, and a pair of bright red lips that refer to the local rug company Magikist make up the body of this iconic work.",3033.0,"Artist

"Campfire, Adirondacks, c. 1892, Winslow Homer","In Campfire, Adirondacks, the guide Rufus Wallace is seated among the sheltering roots of a giant overturned hemlock. The tree’s roots are expressive formal elements in their own right, but these ancient tentacles also seem to protect the resting man. Like many of Homer’s Adirondacks watercolors, Campfire, Adirondacks was conceived on the spot, with washes laid in to suggest areas of light and shadow, but the artist probably finished the work back in his studio in Maine or at the North Woods Club. Conveying a convincing sense of immediacy and spontaneity, Homer’s watercolors were often the result of deliberate planning and several campaigns of painting. Sometimes ephemeral effects were difficult to recapture in the studio, as in the smoke of the campfire where color was applied and blotted repeatedly.",3036.0,"Artist

"Campfire, Adirondacks, c. 1892, Winslow Homer","Visual evidence indicates that Homer used resist to define the crooked tree trunks on the lefthand side of the composition. Without this tool, it would have been impossible to achieve the intricate contours of the trunks while simultaneously applying an even wash to the surroundings. Over a preliminary gray wash, Homer, following his graphite underdrawing, would have brushed on the resist in the shape of the tree trunks. Even before it dried, it would form a strong, cohesive film on the paper’s surface without soaking into the fibers; because oil repels water, it would have remained undisturbed while Homer brushed dark-blue wash across it and the neighboring area. Once the wash dried, he would have scrubbed off the resist with a dull scraper or stiff brush and a solvent such as turpentine. Homer’s vigorous cleaning may have broken up the resist, scattering tiny fragments that became lodged in slow-drying, dense, or gum-rich passages of watercolor elsewhere on the sheet. When he was finished, the forms of the trunks were visible against the blue background.",3036.0,"Artist

There is no sense of three-dimensional space, and he has completely fragmented the form of the figure, which is presumably indicated by the lighter hues of lavender, yellow, and peach in the center. Dawson was essentially self-taught as a painter, his interest in abstraction developed during his early training as a civil engineer in which he studied geometry, calculus, and mechanical drawing. He acknowledged the works of Paul Cézanne as a major influence and was equally indebted to the fractured forms of Cubism.",3041.0,"Artist

He did very likely read about it in a broadsheet with a rudimentary woodcut and a more extensive text description. His surprisingly realistic rendering of how the unseen pig—which died soon after birth—might have looked is similarly convincing but inaccurate.
