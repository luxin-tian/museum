"Untitled (Lighted Dancer), c. 1949, Joseph Cornell","The subject of this box is the dancer Renee “Zizi” Jeanmaire (b. 1924), whom Cornell met in New York in 1949, when she performed in a ballet adaptation of Bizet’s Carmen, partnered by her husband Roland Petit. (That same year, the Hugo Gallery in New York put on a joint exhibition of Cornell’s work on the Romantic Ballet and of Petit’s ballet productions under the title La Lanterne magique du ballet romantique of Joseph Cornell/Decors for Ballets Choreographed by Roland Petit.) Jeanmaire’s flamboyant performances in Carmen “set a high-water mark in the projection of unabashed sexuality in ballet” (New York, Castelli, Feigen, Corcoran, Joseph Cornell and the Ballet, 1983, exh. cat. by Sandra Leonard Starr, p. 74). Cornell’s diary entries record his passionate involvement in a friendship that was, in fact, one-sided, for Jeanmaire barely recalled him (ibid.). In November of 1949, he noted in his diary “grat [itude]. for Zizi different mood from orig. intensity. Less obsession” (ibid., p. 75), and in the same month had a fantasy about her one night while passing the Winter Garden Theater where she was dancing (ibid., p. 7.5 n. 9). It was, however, as the Princess Aurora in La Belle au bois dormant (Sleeping Beauty), the epitome of the Romantic Ballet, that he chose to depict her, rather than as the fiery Carmen.",3053.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Lighted Dancer), c. 1949, Joseph Cornell","Cornell’s use of artificial light, with which he also experimented in some of his bird boxes (see, for example, Untitled (Lighted Bird)), is particularly effective here; the dancer is caught in the spotlight, as if on stage, and the specks of glass and glitter flash in the dim blue light like a sequined costume. As so often in Cornell’s works, the division between the natural and the artificial is erased here, conferring an uncanny character to the scene. The dancer is surrounded not by obvious stage scenery or curtains, but by a large chunk of real tree bark. The viewer has the momentary feeling of looking out from a hole in a tree trunk, like one of Cornell’s owls, onto this moonlit star.",3053.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Bird), 1948, Joseph Cornell","The key detail is the pair of arrows behind the bird’s perch, cut from very thin pieces of wood. Formally, the arrows echo the two dowels, which can move freely on the floor of the box like the disk and ball. The proximity of the arrows to the bird‘s breast suggests a variation on the theme of the bird as victim or target (see, for instance, Habitat Group for a Shooting Gallery, 1943, Des Moines Art Center; New York 1980 –82, pl. XXIII); the relatively plain form of the bird and its whitish color also recall the white dove of peace. Symbolically, the arrows are richly associative. They recall the arrows on sign posts, as well as the black arrows in Giorgio de Chirico’s “playthings” paintings, like The Evil Genius of a King (1914; New York, The Museum of Modern Art; Maurizio Fagiolo dell’ Arco, L’opera completa di De Chrico, 1908-1924, Mil an, 1984, no. 68, ill.) or The Feast Day (1914, Chicago, Neumann collection; ibid., no. 67, ill.). But the conjunction of the arrows with the bird has an even stronger association with the national emblem of the American bald eagle, perched on olive branches and arrows. The effect is somewhat ambiguous: the box could be a simple, folksy version of the American emblem or it could be a critical comment on the immediate postwar era in the United States, with its witch hunts of those involved in so-called un-American activities.",3061.0,"Artist

"Nude Bent Forward, Paris, c. 1930, Lee Miller","Lee Miller began her career as a model in New York during the 1920s, eventually posing for celebrated photographers Edward Steichen and Arnold Genthe. In 1929 she moved to Paris, where she began to develop her own artistic ideas while assisting and then collaborating with Man Ray, a key member of the Surrealist movement. Miller mastered lighting and printing techniques; she also gained a reputation for portraits, fashion photography, and experimental compositions, such as this nude study, with Surrealist themes. In this picture the nude is presented as a modernist sculpture: armless, legless, and with an upended backside that suggests a profound reorientation of the human body. Her male contemporaries—Man Ray, but also Edward Weston—created similar works, but with more overtly erotic connotations. Miller, by contrast, deployed the camera’s potential to render anatomy disquieting while avoiding the offering of sexual titillation.",3065.0,"Artist

Because of the popularity of these works, the artist worried that he would be remembered only “as a painter of fish.” Chase’s training in the Munich style, characterized by scintillating surface texture and careful brushwork, is showcased in North River Shad. Brilliant white strokes form the fish’s iridescent scales, accentuating the weight and density of the voluminous creature at center.

"Close Pin Prop, 1969, Richard Serra","In the late 1960s, Richard Serra pioneered “antiform,” an approach to sculpture that challenged the reductive formalism of Minimalism by focusing on the process or act of creation. Capturing the raw, muscular energy of working with lead and steel, the artist utilized these materials to explore fundamental properties of sculptural tension. In 1968 Serra created his first “props,” consisting of plates and tubes in precarious configurations. Although these works are entirely stable, as all are carefully balanced, they employ gravity as their fundamental support and thus have an unnerving quality. The result is an aggressive sculptural experience evoking potential danger. The title refers to the artist Chuck Close, who visited Serra’s studio when this prop was being made.",3069.0,"Artist

"Cat Making Up, 1962, Inagaki Tomoo","This sketch and final print illustrate the artist’s working method. First, Inagaki Tomoo made a sketch in pencil that he later drew over in ink. He then laid the sketch face down on a wet block and rubbed it from the back to transfer the ink to the block, which he used as a guide for carving. Some of the ink outlines in the sketch have transferred onto the finished print, while other lines have been carved into the wood and therefore carry no color on the paper, as is the case with the contour of the cat’s leg.
Inagaki’s affection for geometric forms is apparent in this print, which has the quality of a stained-glass window. The print collector Oliver Statler, who knew the artist well, has written that there is only one cat in the print—the two heads represent the movement of the bathing cat.",3084.0,"Artist

"Container for Kohl in the Shape of a Palm Column, New Kingdom, mid–Dynasty 18 or 19, about 1352–1213 BC, Ancient Egyptian","Glassworking in Egypt appeared suddenly as a fully developed industry under the pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty (1550–1295 BC) and was probably imported from the older glass centers of the Eastern Mediterranean. During this time glass production was restricted to a handful of workshops producing vessels and objects intended only for the pharaoh and his court. In addition to small glass objects such as beads, amulets, and inlays, the new industry produced a wide variety of glass vessels for unguents, incense, and cosmetics. Particularly popular were vessels like this example made to contain kohl, a black pigment used by both men and women to outline their eyes. The kohl was applied with a thin rod, and the containers were sealed with stoppers made of linen and wax. The shape of this object recalls a palm column, a traditional element of Egyptian architecture. The bright, opaque colors of these early core-formed glass vessels—dark blue, turquoise blue, red, yellow, and white—seem to emulate semiprecious stones such as lapis lazuli, turquoise, and jasper. The rarity of these glass works (only some five hundred complete examples are known) indicates that they were precious commodities.",3089.0,"Culture

He used a seated three-quarter-length format for sitters who did not belong to the nobility, making them appear more approachable.

"Portrait of a Young Woman, c. 1690, Aert de Gelder","One of Rembrandt’s last pupils, Aert de Gelder continued to paint with the glowing colors, shimmering, richly textured surfaces, and psychological penetration of his master’s very late work well into the 18th century. This picture has the appearance of a portrait, but the intimate frontal pose and rather fanciful costume suggest the kind of historicizing character study favored by Rembrandt and his pupils.",3091.0,"Artist

"The Powerhouse, Falls Village, Connecticut, c. 1914, Walter Elmer Schofield","Pennsylvanian Walter Elmer Schofield worked at the St. Ives art colony in Cornwall, England, for much of his
career, but maintained an active presence in the American art world. It was on one of his trips back to his native country that he created The Powerhouse, Falls Village, Connecticut. The artist frequently painted winter scenes; like many Impressionists, he was fascinated by the challenge of rendering snow and its many hues in sunlight and shade. While the winter setting was typical for Schofield, the industrial subject matter was not. In the early nineteenth century Falls Village had been a center for iron production, but by the time the artist painted these buildings, the industry was in a serious decline. The depiction of these snow-covered structures seems to suggest the renewed peace and quiet in the postindustrial town.",3095.0,"Artist

"Figure (Mbulu Ngulu), Late 19th/early 20th century, Kota","Figures related to ongoing communion with the ancestors were once widespread among the various Kota peoples. Reducing the human form to flattened planes, artists accentuated these sculptures with sheets and strips of brass and copper. The metal connoted prosperity while its reflective quality was understood to frighten away evil. The figures’ abstraction inspired the Cubists and other modern European artists in the early 20th century to explore forms of repre-sentation that are not rooted in visual reality.",3096.0,"Culture
