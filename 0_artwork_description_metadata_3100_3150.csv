"The Truck, 1966, George Segal","In the 1960s, when the Abstract Expressionist and Pop Art movements were trans-forming artists’ working methods, George Segal explored the long-established genre of figurative sculpture. He created life-size human figures using cloth strips dipped in wet plaster and displayed the rough, unpainted casts as his finished product. Segal often placed his sculptural forms within a larger tableau of commercially made objects in order to create active, eerily inhabited spaces.",3109.0,"Artist

"The Truck, 1966, George Segal","Purchased in 1966, The Truck was the Art Institute’s first acquisition to incorporate a moving-image element. The artist combined the front of a red Ford F-Series pickup; one of his signature cast-plaster figures as the driver; and the film Highway at Night (projected on the truck’s windshield, in a continuous loop) to create what is now commonly referred to as an environmental sculpture. While today’s audiences for contemporary art are used to having disparate visual elements presented to them in this way, Segal’s early work was truly groundbreaking.
The same year The Truck was acquired, it won first prize in the museum’s Sixty-Eighth American Exhibition. This display, curator A. James Speyer explained in the catalogue, “shows the work of twenty artists, each with a kind of complete, individual exhibit rather than a single, specific painting or sculpture… . All these exhibits share a physical insistence and vital presence which assumes environmental stature.” An article on the show in Time captures both the novelty of The Truck in 1966 and something of what it is like to experience it even now:",3109.0,"Artist

"Desk, 1908, Frank Lloyd Wright","Frank Lloyd Wright considered the Avery Coonley House in Riverside, Illinois, to be one of his most successful projects; he designed everything in the house, including the carpets, table service, and linens, and, according to one anecdote, “even some of Mrs. Coonley’s dresses to harmonize with the interiors.” This desk was made for the home’s rear guest room and reflects the intersecting geometric forms and broad cantilever of its exterior architecture. Wright collaborated on this desk with Milwaukee interior designer George Mann Niedecken, who initially worked for the architect in 1904. Although the feet moldings are more typical of Niedecken’s designs, he likely worked from Wright’s own sketches to complete the desk.",3111.0,"Artist

"Major-General Henry Dearborn, 1812, Gilbert Stuart","Gilbert Stuart’s idealized portrayal of Major-General Henry Dearborn presents an aging, yet robust military leader invigorated by power and the challenge of the War of 1812.

This work is one of several likenesses Stuart executed of American
military and political men, among them his well-known depictions of George Washington. Stuart painted directly on the panel or canvas over the course of several sittings, capturing the new country’s fervent nationalism in skillful, vigorous portraits.",3115.0,"Artist

"Prout’s Neck, Breakers, 1883, Winslow Homer","Homer’s decision to move to Maine in 1883 presumably indicated his desire to live close to nature—Prout’s Neck was a peninsula known for its rocky coastline and dramatic views of the Atlantic Ocean. Prout’s Neck, Breakers, later the model for the monumental oil painting Early Morning after a Storm at Sea, shows the artist’s continued fascination with the power of the sea. However, unlike his earlier marine works, this and other watercolors made at Prout’s Neck are usually devoid of human activity, exploring nature’s grandeur in its many manifestations. This work also exemplifies important aspects of Homer’s technique as a watercolorist, including the way he layered strokes of color—using a range of light and dark blues—to create the depth and force of the breaking waves. He used the white of the paper to produce a brilliant sheen on the sea, juxtaposed with a hazy sky above.",3116.0,"Artist

"Earthly Paradise, 1888, Paul Gauguin","This exceptional object attests to the spirit of collaboration and competition between Paul Gauguin and the younger artist Emile Bernard in the late 1880s. It also speaks to their experimentations with radical new styles and techniques and their desire to break down the hierarchy between painting and applied or decorative art. On three of the five panels, Bernard (left vertical) and Gauguin (center panel and probably top panel) carved men, women, animals, and apple trees inspired by village life at Pont Aven, motifs that they also used in their paintings. On the right panel, however, Gauguin carved figures from his trip the previous year to the tropical island of Martinique, which presaged his future voyages to Tahiti.",3117.0,"Artist

"Untitled (For Tamara Toumanova), c. 1940, Joseph Cornell","Like Hommage à Tamara Toumanova, this box (also known as Feathered Swan) was made for the ballerina Tamara Toumanova. Cornell saw Toumanova perform Swan Lake in 1941, and he subsequently often associated her with this role. The swan here evidently suggests her presence, floating as it does above feathers that more vividly evoke the dancer’s costume than the bird itself. Cornell did on occasion incorporate actual fragments of the dancer’s costume in his tributes to Toumanova. On the back of one of these, Swan Lake for Tamam Toumanova (1946, Houston, Menil Foundation), Cornell wrote, “An actual wisp or two of a white feather from a head piece worn by Toumanova in Swan Lake mingles with the larger ones bordering the box” (Christine Hennessey, “ Joseph Cornell : A Balletomane,” Archives of American Art Journal 23, 3 [1983], p. 11 and fig. 2).

"Human Figure with Two Birds, 1925/29, Max Ernst","Like Constantin Brâncusi, Max Ernst was fascinated with birds, and among his earliest works incorporating this motif are some two dozen small, unconventional pictures made around 1925. One of these works was incorporated as a picture within a picture in Human Figure with Two Birds, a painting that set the stage for an extraordinary series of works that Ernst began in 1930, which featured a large, fantastic bird figure that the artist identified as Loplop. In these works, Loplop, the artist’s ""private phantom attached to my person,"" generally holds up a picture for presentation. Here the rudimentary figure outlined in white is an early manifestation of Loplop, Ernst’s playful, surreal concept of self-portraiture by proxy.",3123.0,"Artist

"Spring in France, 1890, Robert William Vonnoh","Robert Vonnoh was among the first American painters to explore Impressionism. He received his formative artistic training in Boston and headed to Paris in the early 1880s for further instruction. By the late 1880s, Vonnoh had settled in Grez-sur-Loing, a rural area outside of Paris that attracted a growing colony of artists who worked en plein air. Here, using a brilliant palette, broken brushstrokes, and unblended colors, Vonnoh captured the budding vegetation and warming sunlight of a spring day. Alongside intense greens, peaches and lavenders convey the dappled light and shadows of a winding road at right. Although no figures appear in Spring in France, the composition suggests a domestic setting, with fence posts delimiting a

"Louise Nude on a Sofa, 1895, Suzanne Valadon","As the current exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity demonstrates, women in the late 19th century were regularly defined by their attire. Clothing, makeup, and accessories frequently reflected not only a woman’s social status but also her character and morality. Scholar Justine De Young has observed of the period, “Dressing fashionably and in good taste thus became one of the central concerns of a bourgeois woman’s daily life, as not merely her appearance but also her reputation was at stake.” The same strict rules of public presentation did not necessarily apply, however, to the private, domestic sphere—as the images in this gallery illustrate. Shown here are women in the process of dressing or undressing; relaxing in their underclothes, nightgowns, or morning dress; or in the most private of moments: sleeping or reclining nude. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s print portfolio Elles most likely depicts prostitutes during the course of the day, but these prints could easily represent the interior life of any woman, as they illustrate common boudoir behaviors: the toilette, lounging in bed, grooming, and conversing with friends. Prints by Childe Hassam, Edvard Munch, James McNeill Whistler, and Paul Gavarni show women wearing peignoirs or dressing gowns. These garments were typically worn by upper class women while they went about their regular morning activities: attending to the servants or the children, catching up on reading and correspondence, and other routine household concerns.",3139.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Sequestered Bower), c. 1948, Joseph Cornell","The title Sequestered Bower commonly attributed to this work seems to derive from Cornell’s humorous description of one of his Owl Boxes, in a diary note of July 10, 1948, as “Large SEQUESTERED BOWER “ (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1058; cited in Dawn Ades, “The Transcendental Surrealism of Joseph Cornell,” in New York 1980–82, p. 41). The “habitat” of bark and dried moss further links this box to Cornell‘s Owl Boxes (Untitled (Large Owl)and Untitled (Lighted Owl)) and suggests that it was made during the same period. The substitution of a blonde, naked, female plastic doll with painted red lips for the owl, whose habitat she occupies, is startling. The box is disturbing on several levels. The contrast between the owl in its natural habitat and the doll/woman, whose appearance is as emphatically artificial as her setting is unnatural, produces an unusually jarring effect. Is she to be understood as displacing the owl or as being herself trapped or displaced? The ambiguity of the figure—child‘s toy but also child-woman – is underlined by the mirrors hidden inside the bark and placed at an angle on either side of her, which allow her to be viewed from the side. This mode of presentation is redolent of a strip club rather than of the vanitas or memento mori theme, which often included a mirror and was linked to the Owl Boxes. The idea of the femme-enfant hints at a premature sexuality which inevitably suggests a connection with Hans Bellmer and Balthus. Cornell would certainly have been aware of Bellmer’s articulated Poupee; photographs of the doll had earlier been reproduced in the French Surrealist journal Minotaure (see Hans Bellmer, “Poupee: Variations sur Ie montage d’une mineure articulee,” Minotaure 6 [Winter 1934–35], pp. 30-31; Bellmer’s Jointure de boules in Minotaure 8 [1936], p. 9; and an untitled photograph by Bellmer of the Poupee, de fenceless, in a wooded environment, which was published adjacent to Cornell ‘s Glass Bell, in Minotaure 10 (1937, p. 34).",3142.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Sequestered Bower), c. 1948, Joseph Cornell","However, rather than emulate Bellmer’s violent dismantling of the female doll‘s body, Cornell left his doll intact. There is just a suspicion here that Cornell is making a faintly ironic protest at Bellmer’s over-explicit and aggressive works; he was uneasy with the “darker” side of Surrealism, which he saw in the work of Max Ernst and surely in Ballmer. The manicured primness of this doll, with its overlarge head, in its grim setting, provides such a strong contrast to Bellmer’s Poupee that it is hard not to find humor in it.",3142.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Sequestered Bower), c. 1948, Joseph Cornell","Although immured in a forest enclave, the doll in the Bergman box seems an unlikely Rapunzel or Sleeping Beauty. It should be noted, however, that she is the type of doll whose eyes close when she is tilted back ward, and unlikely as it may seem, given the fragility of the other materials in the box, this raises the possibility that this box, too, is a kind of toy: a Sleeping Beauty toy.",3142.0,"Artist

"Female Figure (Akua’ba), Mid–19th/early 20th century, Fante","Among the Fante and related peoples the desire for children is expressed through rituals that may include the fabrication of a stylized figure called akua’ba. Because women are highly valued in Fante society for their procreative powers, female figures are favored over male ones. Adorned with beaded necklaces, waistbands, and anklets, and sporting a horned hairstyle that was fashionable in the 19th and early 20th centuries, this example’s features reflect local ideals of physical beauty.",3148.0,"Culture

"Hercules Killing Cacus, 1588, Hendrick Goltzius","To make a chiaroscuro woodcut, an artist uses a separate woodblock for printing each different color of ink. Often, as was the case for both of these prints, the image was rendered primarily in a line block, usually in black. The additional colors—together with the color of the paper itself—provide more definition to the forms and more dramatic light effects.
The virtuoso graphic artist Hendrick Goltzius used the chiaroscuro woodcut technique to great effect in his depiction of Hercules completing the 10th of his 12 labors: the capture of the cattle of Geryon. To accomplish this feat, he had to vanquish the giant Cacus. Goltzius shows the moment just before Hercules violently clubs the giant, which is made especially dramatic by the vivid conjunction of yellow and green.
Although Goltzius’s advances in line engraving found many followers, few artists pursued his equally original exploration of chiaroscuro woodcuts printed from one line block and multiple tone blocks. The largest, and one of the earliest of the chiaroscuro woodcuts from Goltzius’s workshop, this dramatic print is also the only one to have a date cut into the block. Here Hercules slays Cacus, a cattle thief, in his cave in the Aventine hills.",3149.0,"Artist
