"Sailboat, 1932, John Marin","Noting Marin’s eye for watercraft, one contemporary critic went so far as to subtitle an article on the artist “Yachtsmen and Painters Alike Unite in Their Praise of Marin Sailboats.” Marin himself adopted the schooner image as a kind of personal talisman, incorporating it into his works in all media, including this simple yet striking 1932 etching. That the schooner motif took on a symbolic role for him is also suggested by the frequency with which he began enclosing it within drawn or painted boxes and borders, sometimes superimposing these like collaged decals onto larger compositions.",3165.0,"Artist

"Roger and Angelica Mounted on the Hippogriff, modeled c. 1840 (cast c. 1884), Antoine Louis Barye","Chivalric tales from the Renaissance—especially the Italian epic poem Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto (1516)—were a popular source of artistic inspiration in the early 19th century. This scene from Orlando Furioso shows the knight Roger saving the maiden Angelica from a dragon. This group formed part of a decorative ensemble for a chimney piece, which was commissioned by the Duc de Montpensier, the younger son of King Louis-Philippe, around 1840. It proved so popular that the composition was recast frequently during and after Barye’s lifetime.",3167.0,"Artist

"Mills and Footbridge, Meaux, 1908, John Marin","Marin made repeated trips to Meaux, an old mill town 25 miles northeast of Paris. Here dabs of diluted pink, red, and yellow suggest the movement of clouds, figures, and wind. Marin painted the sky with long, dry brushstrokes, then defined the clouds, working wet-into-wet by dripping in dilute washes of color that dispersed the pigment and yielded dark, feathered lines. After the washes dried, he punctuated the remaining white of the sky with yellow marks to add brightness. Demonstrating an intuitive understanding of how watercolor behaves, as well as a willingness to experiment with unpredictable results, Marin found such manipulations liberating. This was among the 25 watercolors shown at Stieglitz’s 291 in the spring of 1909, the first time the gallery owner exhibited Marin’s work.",3175.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Hôtel de l’Etoile), 1954, Joseph Cornell","This was one of the first boxes Edwin Bergman acquired directly from Cornell. Following Bergman’s first visit to the artist‘s home in mid-September 1959, Cornell wrote about the travel arrangements for the box in a letter: “I wanted to see the “Night Sky” box under way before I wrote to thank you for your courtesy in bringing me the fairy tokens from the Dorazios. As to the former it got under way on Friday via Railway Express and I believe that it will arrive in the same condition as you saw it. I have kept a tracing of the inner spattered “pane” in case of breakage, and so will you kindly advise if such it might require?” (Joseph Cornell, unpublished letter to Edwin Bergman of September 20, 1959). This letter is revealing of the artist’s attitude to replacement parts for his boxes and to his titles, which he used in a generic, descriptive way, rather than as precise labels.",3177.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Hôtel de l’Etoile), 1954, Joseph Cornell","A large vertical opening is cut into the box’s rear wall to reveal the interior of a smaller box. A pane of clear glass is placed behind the opening, through which a panel covering the rear wall of the smaller box is visible. This panel, which may well be of glass (thus explaining Cornell‘s reference in the above letter to an “inner spattered ‘pane’”), is painted dark blue and spattered with white paint to resemble a constellation.

"Untitled (Hôtel de l’Etoile), 1954, Joseph Cornell","Cornell’s interest in both the scientific and imaginative aspects of the study of the stars is well documented. Here, there is a perfect balance between the three main elements of the image: the title, which introduces the multiple associations with glamour and travel of the word “star”; the “abstract” pattern of a constellation formed by the spattered paint, which resembles scientific photographs of the night sky, taken with the assistance of telescopes; and the figurative representation of the myth of Auriga, after which the constellation is named. The image of Auriga Cornell used in this box derives from Johannes Hevelius’s star atlas, Uranographia totum coelum stellatum, published in 1690 (see Giuseppe Maria Sesti, The Glorious Constellations: History and Mythology, New York, 1991, p. 256, ill.).

"Untitled (Hôtel de l’Etoile), 1954, Joseph Cornell","“The mythology of Auriga is not clear, but the ancients seem to have been of one mind in regarding the constellations as representing the figure of a man carrying a goat and her two kids in his arms. Auriga was also looked upon as a beneficent constellation, and the goat kids were believed to be on the watch to rescue shipwrecked sailors. As Capella, which represents the fabled goat, shines nearly overhead in winter; and would ordinarily be the first bright star to beam down through the breaking clouds of a storm at that season, it is not difficult to imagine how it got its reputation as the seaman’s friend. Auriga as a constellation, was in vented long before the time of the Greeks, and was intended prophetically to represent that Good Shepherd who was to come and rescue the sinful world.”",3177.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Hôtel de l’Etoile), 1954, Joseph Cornell","This romantic and Christian interpretation of the myth of Auriga is strikingly different from the one given by Catherine Tennant. She emphasized a different stage of the myth: that Auriga was Erecthonious, future king of Athens, deformed son of Earth and Vulcan, who was placed in a box by Athena and given to the care of two
maidens, who opened the box and “when they saw the child inside, entwined by a serpent … fled in terror and fell to their death from the Acropolis” (Box of Stars, London, 1993, p. 27). Characteristically, Cornell focused on the beneficent rather than the malevolent aspects of the myth.",3177.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Hôtel de l’Etoile), 1954, Joseph Cornell","The words Hotel de l’Etoile, which Cornell incorporated into this box, point directly to stargazing. Moreover, these words are thought to refer to the ballet Le Rendez-vous, whose set design by Brassaï included huge photographic enlargements of hotel logos (see Sandra Leonard Starr, in New York, Castelli, Feigen, Corcoran, Joseph Cornell and the Ballet, 1983, exh. cat., p. 75).

"Untitled (Hôtel de l’Etoile), 1954, Joseph Cornell","The trail of spattered paint, intended to evoke a constellation of stars, is also interesting in relation to the new painting practices in New York at the time, which were in turn influenced by Surrealist automatism. Both Max Ernst and Jackson Pollock had experimented with paint-dripping in their work. It is thus possible, given the profusion of both veiled and explicit references to other artists in Cornell‘s work, that the white trail of paint refers to this new development as well, and reflects the artist’s capacity to internalize and play with aspects of abstraction that otherwise seem alien to his art.",3177.0,"Artist
