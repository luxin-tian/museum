"Fruit Piece, 1860, Hannah Brown Skeele","Hannah Brown Skeele earned acclaim for her delicate still-life compositions both in her home state of Maine and in Saint Louis, where she worked and exhibited in the 1860s. In Fruit Piece, her earliest known painting, a dessert course communicates refinement both in terms of the rare edibles themselves an in their careful presentation. In the mid-19th century pineapples, lemons, oranges, and even bananas were imported specialties, shipped along the Mississippi River from New Orleans. These exotic fruits were available in limited quantities and served by families with means on special occasions such as holidays or dinner parties.",3200.0,"Artist

"Loutrophoros (Container for Bath Water), 350/340 BC, Ancient Greek","The type of tall, cylindrical vessel with spiraling handles shown here was made only in Apulia. Lavishly decorated, its purpose was to hold water for ritual bathing before marriage. Its body is divided into two zones, each featuring four beautifully clothed, coiffed and bejeweled women, alternately standing and sitting as they chat with a companion. Such vases were also placed in the tombs of unmarried girls to mark their union with Hades, god of the underworld. This vase might have served that such a purpose, since the reverse depicts a woman within a funerary naiskos, or temple-like structure. Seated and standing females bear gifts and offerings.",3201.0,"Culture

"Fragment from Christ Carrying the Cross: Saint John the Evangelist, 1500/05, Jean Hey, (the Master of Moulins)","These two fragments are all that remain of a painting of Christ carrying the Cross by Jean Hey, the leading painter working in France at the end of the 15th century. Saint John the Evangelist was acquired by the Chicago collector Martin Ryerson in the 1890s; Mourning Virgin, recently identified as a fragment of the same work, was acquired in 2004. Technical examination showed traces of the cross and the head of Christ on both fragments and also provided evidence to connect them to another panel in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, depicting a saint and donor. These fragments were thus formerly part of an intensely emotional image of Christ’s road to Calvary, which would have formed the left half of a diptych, or portable folding altarpiece, with the representation of the donor in prayer on the right.",3206.0,"Artist

"Dancer and Gazelles, 1916, Paul Manship","This graceful trio by Paul Manship exemplifies his ability to synthesize different artistic influences in his work. The dancer, raised elegantly on the balls of her feet, gestures with her arms toward the two gazelles. Her pose is reminiscent of figures in medieval Indian paintings while the stylized draped fabric of her skirt recalls archaic Greek sculpture. Manship demonstrated his keen eye for detail in the intricate linear ornament that adorns the skirt and the base of the sculpture. Despite the artist’s assimilation of past art forms, works like Dancer and Gazelles were seen as fresh and original; as one critic noted in 1916 “the extreme modernists and the academicians united in paying tribute to his genius.”",3210.0,"Artist

"Self-Portrait with Camera, c. 1917, Edward Steichen","Edward Steichen negotiated many spaces of display over the course of his career: from his early training as a painter and his involvement in the Photo-Secession, an amateur group led by Alfred Stieglitz; to his service as a military photographer, and then a studio photographer for Condé Nast magazines; and later, to his curatorial endeavors at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. This self-portrait, taken around 1917, presents the artist’s frank assessment of himself at a pivotal moment in his career. Distancing himself from the soft-focus sentimentality of the Photo-Secession, Steichen broke with his mentor, Alfred Stieglitz (who had earlier abandoned that group), and stopped painting. Responding in 1915 to a questionnaire from Stieglitz, Steichen declared his wish that photography galleries like Stieglitz’s remain receptive to new elements, such as the crisp and straightforward aesthetic advanced in this self-portrait.



Edward Steichen was an early champion of Pictorialism, which promoted photography as a fine art; a painter as well as a photographer, he photographed himself in 1902 in soft focus, holding an artist’s brush and palette, and produced the image as a handmade gum print. Fifteen years later, his style and intentions had changed. This self-portrait, made on the eve of Steichen’s participation in World War I, shows the artist in sharp clarity with his studio camera, assessing himself frankly and cementing his new identity as strictly a photographer. He served as the commander of the photographic division for the United States Army Expeditionary Forces Air Service, documenting terrain in preparation for bombing sorties (a position to which he returned during World War II). Steichen worked in the 1920s and 1930s in magazines and advertising, before becoming curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.",3213.0,"Artist

"Point Breeze, the Estate of Joseph Napoleon Bonaparte at Bordentown, New Jersey, 1817/20, Charles B. Lawrence","Although based in Philadelphia, landscape and portrait painter Charles Lawrence was born near Bordentown, New Jersey, the site of the idyllic scene pictured here. Point Breeze was the name of the country estate owned by Joseph Napoleon Bonaparte (the older brother of the French emperor Napoleon I), who fled to America after his brother’s fall from power. Under a warm, golden light, Napoleon’s homestead presides atop a hill, with a stone bridge, lake, curving paths, gently sloping hills, and bucolic vegetation creating a picturesque vista. The artist’s tight, detailed style, infused with green and autumnal hues, aptly captures the romantic feel of this cultivated landscape.",3214.0,"Artist

"Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Hadrian, 120/23, issued by Hadrian, Ancient Roman","Portraits of important people appear on local currency all around the world. The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BC. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person—Julius Caesar—appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire.",3218.0,"Culture

While the front side depicted the sovereign’s portrait, the back was often used to communicate the ruler’s accomplishments or aspirations. Until Late Antiquity, portraits usually appeared in profile. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, with one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how coins are created today.",3218.0,"Culture

"Centre Bridge, 1904, Edward Willis Redfield","Edward Willis Redfield, a leading member of a group of Impressionists located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, most frequently painted the landscape around his hand-built home in the river town of Center Bridge. His intimate familiarity with this land, and his commitment to recording its ever-changing appearance, is apparent in Centre Bridge, a wintry portrayal of the hillside above the town overlooking the Delaware River. Despite the painting’s look of immediacy, Redfield carefully composed the picture to emphasize the sweeping hillside and dramatic panoramic view of the valley, using a variety of brushstrokes. The flair of his technique and local flavor of his subject matter brought Redfield enormous critical and popular acclaim as the creator of art that seemed to reflect a distinctly American character: fresh, vigorous, and rough-hewn.",3219.0,"Artist

Along with Theo van Doesburg, Hélion founded Art Concret (later known as Abstract-Création), the first French avant-garde group devoted to radical abstraction. In 1936 Hélion moved to the United States and, at the invitation of László Moholy-Nagy, took a teaching position at Chicago’s New Bauhaus (later renamed the Illinois Institute of Technology). This painting, produced during Hélion’s time in the United States, exemplifies his continuing exploration of abstraction, injecting rhythmic color and organic form into his compositions.

The following year, however, Antony returned to Rome and prepared a long-awaited campaign against the Parthians. Yet Octavian failed to support the endeavor. Disappointed, Antony left Italy and sailed to Alexandria, where he renewed his relationship with Cleopatra. Meanwhile, the triumvirate disintegrated, and Octavian rose to power in Rome. Eventually Antony broke off relations with Octavian, and in 31 B.C. civil war broke out again. The decisive sea battle was fought at Actium, a promontory in northern Greece. As depicted in the tapestry, the Egyptian fleet was destroyed by the Romans, and Antony fled to Egypt in Cleopatra’s boat. In 30 B.C., Octavian invaded Egypt. Rather than surrender to his enemy, Antony committed suicide. A few days later, Cleopatra followed his example. Their tragic deaths are not included in this suite.",3249.0,"Artist
