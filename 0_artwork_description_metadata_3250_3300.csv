"Death Comes to an Old Lady, 1969, Duane Stephen Michals","Duane Michals initially turned to photography beginning in the late 1950s, following a brief career as a graphic designer. A decade later he began creating narrative sequences that play on themes such as desire, memory, dreams, and mortality. Composed of a succession of events, these staged scenes utilize cinematic language, but ultimately refer to specifically photographic tools. Whereas film stills depict single moments in time, many of Michals’s images show blurred figures, implying movement within each “frame.” Unlike the narrative sequence of a film, these images are open to individual interpretation and yield no overarching storyline. For this sequence, Michals enlisted his grandmother to animate his fascination with mortality, noting, “I am compulsive in my preoccupation with death. In some way, I am preparing myself for my own death.",3258.0,"Artist

Striding purposefully forward, with a knotty walking stick in one hand and his Bible in the other, the figure embodies the perseverance, resilience, and stern morality that late-19th-century Americans admired in their colonial forebears. Appealing to the period’s Colonial Revival sensibility, the statue proved immensely popular, and Saint-Gaudens consequently created a smaller, generalized version to sell in multiples, which he entitled simply The Puritan.",3259.0,"Artist

"Conversation in Studio, 1943, Milton Avery","Milton Avery was an American artist known for his study and usage of color, often referred to as a precursor to Color Field painters. His work frequently bridged the gap between realist and abstract art. The four figures in Conversation in the Studio have not been identified; however, meetings like these were a common occurrence in both Avery’s New York apartment and art studio. American artists such as Mark Rothko and Adolph Gottlieb among others would often stop by to see and discuss Avery’s work, while Avery in turn would sketch the gatherings and conversations taking place around him. The artist himself addressed this tendency, asking “why talk when you can paint?” The flat color fields and textured application of thin paint layers give shape and structure to the elegantly dressed figures and their surroundings. By the 1940s, Avery was increasingly using a nonnaturalistic palette to create mood in his paintings, as the bright-blue and green faces of the men demonstrate.",3266.0,"Artist

"Children Sitting on a Fence, 1874, Winslow Homer","During the years of Reconstruction (1865–1876), children and childhood were popular subjects in art and literature, representing both the nation’s hope for the future and its nostalgia for the simpler, more innocent era that preceded the great social and economic upheavals of the Civil War. Homer understood and fostered this conception of childhood; small groups of children in rural settings dominate his work of the early 1870s. The graphite study Children Sitting on a Fence, on which the watercolor Children on a Fence (1874) is based, shows how Homer used monochrome drawings to study figure relationships and to map out the primary patterns of light and shadow. Although the small figure group of children poised on the upper rail of a fence remains essentially the same between the drawing and the watercolor, the white highlights on the children’s hats and bodies in the drawing differ from the highlights Homer employed in the watercolor, suggesting that his treatment of light was sometimes improvised away from the scene. His preparatory drawings served as guides but did not prevent experimentation in the studio.",3281.0,"Artist

"Black-and-White Storage Jar with Abstract Geometric Motifs, 1890s, Acoma","In the American Southwest, there is an Indian ceramic tradition that began to take form in the early centuries A.D. and has continued unbroken to the present time. Characterized by its many superbly varied styles, the art has been sustained by diverse Pueblo peoples and some of their neighbors, whose ancient and more recent settlements have long been established in the arid regions of Arizona and New Mexico. Ceramic artist of the Ácoma Pueblo, west of Albuquerque, produced an especially distinguished series of vessels during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
This large olla is shaped with a truncated neck that slopes in a gentle curve to the high, rounded shoulder; the full, swelling body tapers smoothly down to the rounded bottom. A finely painted pattern of black-and white abstract designs covers the surface. The dominant decorative features are three medallions, each rimmed by black petals. Within each medallion, and divided by a central vertical strip adorned with zigzag triangles, are twin semicircular, double-ended bands filled with fine hatch marks; these, in turn, enclose inner designs of curving, triangular elements. The medallions themselves are separated by diamonds that frame hatched checkerboards, while complex triangular elements step down from the rim and up from the red-painted bottom. The austere color and multiple abstract motifs stem from past centuries of Anasazi (Ancestral Pueblo) ceramic styles. As is often seen in early works, the artist presents playful visual ambiguities between positive and negative space.

Hills of Byram was executed in March 1909 in Point Pleasant, overlooking the river and the distant quarry on the border of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Bare trees, dead grasses, and the pale sky evoke a crisp spring day, freely painted with a flickering yet controlled touch. Although Garber’s painting appears impressionistic, he prized form and structure, and carefully planned his compositions. He spent months observing the land in different conditions and making studies before embarking upon the final picture in the studio.",3288.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1969, Robert Irwin","“How is it that a space could ever come to be considered empty when it is filled with real and tactile events?” Robert Irwin asked in 1977. A pioneering figure in California Light and Space art, Irwin had launched a series of luminous disk paintings one decade prior: Untitled comprises a single, spray-painted, convex plastic disk, cantilevered 12 inches from the wall. Four lights are angled toward the disk to produce a diaphanous array of overlapping shadows. These seem to merge with the painting’s radiant core, blurring the distinction between what is material and what is immaterial. On the one hand, Irwin’s work is elusive and illusory. On the other hand, the artist’s explorations of perceptual phenomena led him to conclude that “all ideas and values have their roots in experience,” which is always, importantly, “conditional.”",3292.0,"Artist

In his series Pictures of Chocolate, Muniz used Bosco syrup to recreate iconic images from fine art. Muniz had to work quickly to finish and photograph his drawings before the syrup dried and lost its glossy look. In fact, Muniz turned to color photography for the first time in this project because of Bosco’s resemblance in black and white to blood (for which it was used in early horror films, including Psycho). This image of Andy Warhol’s 1963 Double Elvis—itself already an appropriation of a famous Hollywood photograph—thus takes on another layer of representation in its turn from portrait to memento mori.",3293.0,"Artist

Never affiliated with a particular movement, her work was nonetheless extremely influential.
With great wit and ingenuity, Exter drew upon many of the most revolutionary developments in early 20th-century art: the widespread fascination with machines and mechanical beings; the use of unorthodox materials; the trend toward geometric abstraction; and the expanded definition of art that includes previously neglected traditions, such as non-Western, folk, and the applied arts.",3299.0,"Artist
