"Sketch for “Oath on the Rütli,” Female Figure (verso), 1779/81; 1785/90 (verso), Henry Fuseli","Although Henry Fuseli spent most of his career in England, he was born Johann Heinrich Füssli in Zurich, a city that fostered early Romantic ideas. His first important commission was for the large painting The Oath on the Rütli in the city hall of Zurich. This sketch is a preliminary study for that work. It depicts the oath sworn on the Rütli meadow in 1291 by representatives of three Swiss cantons (territories) against the ambitions of their Habsburg overlords. Fuseli’s dynamic, elongated figures, which were strongly influenced by Mannerist art, are less an accurate representation of the historical past than they are an expression of the universal desire for freedom.",3306.0,"Artist

"The Alcoholic, 1978, Gilbert & George","Gilbert Proesch and George Passmore met in 1967 as students at St. Martin’s School of Art in London. By 1969 they dropped their surnames in order to rid themselves of their separate artistic identities and became a collaborative unit. Although they work in a variety of media, including performance, photography, film, and video, Gilbert & George refer to all of their work as sculpture. Early on, they performed as “living sculptures,” making themselves their own subject matter. In 1971 Gilbert & George made their first multipanel photographs, which have remained their dominant form of expression. In the 1970s, they gradually shifted the emphasis of their art away from their own experiences to larger social issues, scrutinizing the inner-city realities that confronted them on the streets of London.",3310.0,"Artist

"Altarpiece from Thuison-les-Abbeville: Saint Honoré, 1490/1500, French School","This panel was once part of the altarpiece decorating the high altar of the Carthusian monastery at Thuison, outside of Abbeville in northern France. Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings. When the wings were open, the interior of the altarpiece told the story of Christ’s Passion and Resurrection through painted narratives on the inside of the wings and painted and gilded carvings in the central shrine whose central subject was undoubtedly the Crucifixion. The carvings have not survived. The fronts and backs of the wings were sawn apart in the mid 19th century; all the wing panels except one narrative (The Entry into Jerusalem, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg) are in the Art Institute.",3317.0,"Artist

"The White Race, 1937, René Magritte","This painting, the fourth in a series entitled The White Race, fascinated Surrealist patron and collector Edward James when he saw it in a preview of the landmark 1938 International Exhibition of Surrealism in Paris. The fragile, reconstructed personage, made of sensory organs and sensitive body parts, compelled James to write to Magritte; he told the artist how the strange, disarticulated body parts “are not distorted in themselves; they challenge us, demand our attention, through their disintegration.” Introspectively, Magritte replied: “This picture gave me the opportunity, in my turn, to ask questions of the public; I would ask visitors if they couldn’t tell me why I had given the figure two noses.” Magritte’s reconstructed body suggests a new hierarchy of values, one privileging the senses and instinct over intellect.",3323.0,"Artist

"Near Newport, 1869, John Frederick Kensett","In this late work, John Frederick Kensett portrayed the Rhode Island coast with spare, yet meticulous forms suffused with light and quietude. A solitary female figure seated at right almost goes unnoticed amid the long, horizontal bands of earth and water. It is the expansive sky that dominates the composition, suggestive of a spiritual force in nature. Kensett, who first trained as an engraver, applied draftsman’s precision to his paintings of the American landscape. Near Newport hints at the tourist activities that would come to define the town in the late 19th century, with couples walking along the distant shore and bathing tents dotting the horizon.",3325.0,"Artist

"the moment, 2005, Doug Aitken","Doug Aitken’s acclaimed video installations take aim at what it means to live in an age when human experience is increasingly shaped by the mediating effects of technology and an unprecedented degree of mobility. Many of his videos unfold as journeys through desolate places in which the natural and the artificial begin to blend. Others offer technology-inflected visions of landscapes in a state of flux. Aitken described his body of work as a series of “structures which move outward in different trajectories and yet share a connection.” He went on to say, “If I create a work which is intensely human, then maybe the next work I want to make is as far from that as possible. It is a constantly evolving process of point and counterpoint.” The three works by Aitken in the Art Institute’s collection—monsoon, thaw, and the moment—vary in their formal qualities and subject matter, but they all pursue similar themes. Additionally, they provide a sense of how Aitken has used the spatial configurations of his multichannel installations in increasingly ambitious ways to extend his films’ narratives beyond the edges of the screen.
If Aitken’s projects often describe how technology shapes our relation to place and our ways of being in the world, in a more abstract manner the artist explores how technology and motion can inform our notions of space and time. In a brief but prescient passage in a 1950 essay, the philosopher Martin Heidegger described how developments in the technology of media (film, radio, and television) and transportation (the railroad and the automobile) gave rise to a condition of uniform “distancelessness” in which “everything is equally far and equally near.” Aitken’s art seems to focus on these cultural conditions in an advanced state, more than forty years later. He has remarked, “On some level, all of my work is related to what I see as certain new tendencies in the culture … Accelerated nomadicism, self-contained, decentralized communication—these things are at the core of the space we’re living in, a terrain that is radically different from the past.”
Of all his works, Aitken’s large-scale video installation the moment perhaps deals with these ideas most explicitly. The installation consists of eleven screens suspended from the ceiling in an S-pattern and, as the video begins, the darkened gallery resounds with a hushed whisper that declares “I want to be every place.” The piece then presents a tightly orchestrated sequence of views that show people waking up in hotel rooms or nondescript dwellings and moving out into largely deserted cities. As the fragmented narrative progresses, anonymous characters engage in similar sets of activities, which emphasizes a common state of being—an urge to get moving, to be everywhere—if also a degree of isolation.
The configuration of the moment continues the themes of movement and unrest while providing a figurative parallel between human travels and the flow of images around and to us. The visitor to Aitken’s installation navigates a dark, wide-open gallery space to view the work, prompting a state of wandering that recalls that of the film’s subjects. Depending on where one stands, the visual relationship between the different screens changes, and each monitor has a mirror on its back, which expands the visual field dramatically and creates a kaleidoscopic flurry of imagery in certain viewing positions. At the same time, the channels are not static—the narrative threads do not play on set monitors but instead migrate across the eleven screens in different ways as the video progresses. For much of its duration, variations of similar scenes play across the screens simultaneously, enacted by different characters; occasionally, however, a single image aligns momentarily on all of them. Finally, the images are set into a frantic state of motion, jumping from one screen to the next in quick succession. The looped video builds to a rushing climax before starting over—the characters returning, if only temporarily, to a state of rest.",3328.0,"Artist

"Madonna, 1895/96, Edvard Munch","The intimate dramas playing out in this gallery draw their emotional power from the vulnerability of the exposed human form. Featured in these voyeuristic prints and drawings are private scenes of tragedy, tenderness, and horror, as artists intruded upon such previously forbidden settings as the bedroom, the deathbed, and the crime scene. While Félix Vallotton’s Intimacy woodcuts address the theme of undressing, with John Sloan’s playful Turning Out the Light and Gustav Klimt’s Seated Woman verging into the erotic, other images depict serious illnesses and the deaths of family members, especially children, which were commonplace events throughout the 19th century.",3338.0,"Artist

"Madonna, 1895/96, Edvard Munch","Making an explicit connection between sex and death is Otto Dix’s Murder, which pairs a bloody corpse with two dogs in the act of copulation. The Northern European artists Käthe Kollwitz and Edvard Munch drew on personal experiences for their devastating images of loss, seen here in stark scenes of grief. Kollwitz and the caricaturist Honoré Daumier (in an unusually somber mood) used similar iconographies of partially exposed corpses to make political statements: Daumier criticized the contemporary French government’s excessive response to a lower class riot in his Rue Transnonian, while Kollwitz drew on her own socialist sympathies in evoking war horrors in Raped, part of her series about the disastrous 1525 German Peasants’ War. The scattered feet of the family members in Daumier’s Transnonian and the nearly invisible child’s head to the left of Kollwitz’s splayed female body remind the viewer of these scenes’ universal themes.",3338.0,"Artist
