"The Human Liberty Bell, 1918, Mole & Thomas","During World War I, commercial photographer Arthur Mole partnered with John Thomas to make a series of ""living photographs,"" arranging thousands of soldiers into designs that created optical illusions of patriotic themes such as the American flag, a profile of Woodrow Wilson, and the Statue of Liberty. Completing these massive spectacles required a week or more of preparation. Mole and Thomas spent hours positioning the troops and constructed an enormous tower from which to photograph the arrangement. The ""top"" of these creations could be as far as a quarter mile from the camera, and the final composition only made sense from the camera’s pseudo-aerial point of view. To make The Human Liberty Bell, the photographers employed 25,000 military personnel at Camp Dix, New Jersey, a training ground for the 78th Division of the National Army. The composition made each posing soldier into a piece of the patriotic message.",3401.0,"Artist

"The Old Guitarist, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","Since the early 1960s, David Hockney has sought ways to meld his modern aesthetic style with highly personalized subject matter. He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.",3405.0,"Artist

"The Old Guitarist, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.",3405.0,"Artist

"Virgin and Child with Saint Elizabeth and the Infant Saint John the Baptist, 1628/29, Jacques Blanchard","Like other ambitious painters of his day, Jacques Blanchard began his career with years of travel and study in Italy before establishing himself in Paris. Blanchard’s itinerary took him to Rome, Venice, and Turin, before his return to Paris via Lyon. This tender painting of the Christ Child approached by his cousin, Saint John the Baptist, probably belongs to these years of travel. Blanchard drew on works by Titian and Veronese that he had seen in Venice for the dynamic poses and warm light, but he evidently still felt some uncertainty in the placement of the figures in space.",3417.0,"Artist

Four saints standing in niches were painted on the exterior of the altarpiece’s wings. When the wings were open, the interior of the altarpiece told the story of Christ’s Passion and Resurrection through painted narratives on the inside of the wings and painted and gilded carvings in the central shrine whose central subject was undoubtedly the Crucifixion. The carvings have not survived. The fronts and backs of the wings were sawn apart in the mid 19th century; all the wing panels except one narrative (The Entry into Jerusalem, Hermitage, Saint Petersburg) are in the Art Institute.",3427.0,"Artist

Otto von Bismarck became prime minister of the Prussian state in 1862 and of the unified German Empire in 1871. To a French audience, he was the cruel leader of the Franco- Prussian War (1870–71). With a skull head, pointed Prussian helmet, and Prussian eagle superimposed on his face, Bismarck looms like a poisonous, grasping plant over the destruction of the French countryside. Playing off a noble coat of arms, Guilliaume gave the French enemy a ghoulish image of death.",3428.0,"Artist

Echoing larger social concerns about health at the time, Max Pechstein and his colleagues often escaped the constraints of city life to find a more authentic existence in nature, documenting their experiences in their work. Later, after his relocation to Berlin in 1908, he also made solitary trips to Nidden, a remote fishing village on the Baltic Sea.

Tiffany used lilies in his stained glass a number of times; the Coreys may have been inspired to commission this design by the well-publicized Field of Lilies Window in Tiffany’s chapel at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Lilies were also considered appropriate for commemorative works, since they symbolized resurrection. When Christ Reformed Episcopal Church was demolished in 1962, the Tiffany windows were moved to St. Andrew Reformed Episcopal Church in Tinley Park, Illinois.

"Weights and Measures, 1987, Richard Serra","Capturing the raw, muscular energy required to work with lead and steel, Richard Serra began utilizing these materials in the late 1960s to explore the fundamental properties of sculptural tension. In 1968 he created his first “props,” consisting of plates and tubes, which fall into one of four categories—wall, corner, freestanding, or post-and-lintel. These sculptures entail a stable but unnerving performance of balance. A wall prop made of steel, Weights and Measures is not only visually striking but also physically imposing, experienced as much through the viewer’s sense of his or her own body as through vision. This work is a monumental form created from dense sheets that are not welded or joined; the result is a disquieting, even aggressive sculptural experience. Physical proximity and the sense of precariously balanced weight create a remarkably immediate relationship between space, object, and viewer.",3438.0,"Artist
