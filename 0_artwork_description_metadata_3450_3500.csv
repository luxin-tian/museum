"Beach Scene, 1949, David Smith","David Smith found inspiration for his early work in the Surrealist sculptures of Alberto Giacometti and Hans Arp, as well as the paintings of Arshile Gorky and Joan Miró. Among the first American artists to master the use of steel and other industrial materials, Smith worked as a welder at a Studebaker automobile plant, where he gained firsthand experience with metal. He made Beach Scene early in his career, at a time when he was interested in organic forms and an unplanned, autonomous approach to art making: “I do not work with a conscious and specific conviction about a piece of sculpture,” he explained. “It is always open to change and a new association.”",3450.0,"Artist

"Mrs. Klapp (Anna Milnor), 1814, Thomas Sully","Over the course of his 70-year career, Thomas Sully painted more than two thousand portraits, including Dr. Joseph Klapp and Mrs. Klapp (Anna Milnor). Joseph Klapp was born and raised in Albany, New York, but studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and settled in Philadelphia. In the portrait, Klapp rests his elbow on a medical text, indicating his profession. The books lining the background of the painting also speak to the sitter’s intellectual prowess. The image of Mrs. Klapp, painted in a harmoniously limited color scheme, emphasizes her beauty. Together, the portraits present an image of a sophisticated couple that celebrates their prosperity, intelligence, and taste.",3462.0,"Artist

"A Family On Their Lawn One Sunday in Westchester, New York, 1968, Diane Arbus","Throughout her career, photographer Diane Arbus demonstrated a gift for capturing the unusual and
eccentric in a compelling, thoughtful manner. This now–iconic photograph was originally included in a photo–essay, “Two American Families,” published in the London Sunday Times Magazine. In a letter to her editor, Arbus described encountering the woman pictured here in a bookstore: “I said I wanted to photograph her with husband and children so she suggested I wait till warm weather so I can do it around the pool! … They are a fascinating family. I think all families are creepy in a way.” Part of the caption for the image, based on Arbus’s corresponence, reads, “The parents seem to be dreaming the child and the child seems to be inventing them.",3468.0,"Artist

"Laziness, 1896, Félix Edouard Vallotton","As the current exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity demonstrates, women in the late 19th century were regularly defined by their attire. Clothing, makeup, and accessories frequently reflected not only a woman’s social status but also her character and morality. Scholar Justine De Young has observed of the period, “Dressing fashionably and in good taste thus became one of the central concerns of a bourgeois woman’s daily life, as not merely her appearance but also her reputation was at stake.” The same strict rules of public presentation did not necessarily apply, however, to the private, domestic sphere—as the images in this gallery illustrate. Shown here are women in the process of dressing or undressing; relaxing in their underclothes, nightgowns, or morning dress; or in the most private of moments: sleeping or reclining nude. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s print portfolio Elles most likely depicts prostitutes during the course of the day, but these prints could easily represent the interior life of any woman, as they illustrate common boudoir behaviors: the toilette, lounging in bed, grooming, and conversing with friends. Prints by Childe Hassam, Edvard Munch, James McNeill Whistler, and Paul Gavarni show women wearing peignoirs or dressing gowns. These garments were typically worn by upper class women while they went about their regular morning activities: attending to the servants or the children, catching up on reading and correspondence, and other routine household concerns.",3471.0,"Artist

"Chocolate Jar with Iron-locked Lid, 1725/75, Talavera Poblana","Talavera poblana, a tin-glazed earthenware, was made in the central Mexican town of Puebla beginning in the sixteenth-century. The name likely refers to the majolica-producing city of Talavera de la Reina in Spain. Talavera emulated the designs of fashionable imported Spanish ceramics; like its Spanish prototypes, it showed the influence of Islamic, Chinese, Italian, and French ceramics, all present in cosmopolitan Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and transmitted to Mexico during the colonial period. This chocolate jar–with an iron cover, collar, and lock–would have been used to store valuable commodities like cacao beans. The blue-and-white ornamentation features panels composed of fringed curtains and scrolled leaves that frame long-tailed birds, a popular motif that may recall Chinese export Swatow ware.",3478.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1976, Robert Morris","In Notes on Sculpture, an influential series of essays from 1966, Robert Morris formulated an argument for the rigid, cubic shapes of Minimalist sculpture. Two years later, he dramatically shifted this viewpoint, proposing “anti-form”—sculpture composed of indeterminate objects with indefinite possibilities in which the “material reveals the form.” For Morris, felt could free sculpture from overdetermined structure and allow him to explore its fundamental properties. He began cutting and installing industrial felt in various configurations, ranging from rolled or tangled heaps on the floor to neatly folded geometric patterns hung on a wall. In Untitled the perpetual pull of gravity is an evident and integral part of the work, creating an elegant balance between the weight of the fabric and its overall structur",3484.0,"Artist

"Sunshine and Shadow, Prout’s Neck, 1894, Winslow Homer","As its title implies, Sunshine and Shadow, Prout’s Neck explores a specific effect of light on the sea. This watercolor places the viewer on the rocky Maine shore among the scrub and juniper bushes, the latter rendered in fluid black strokes with an elegance of gesture comparable to Japanese calligraphy. Despite Homer’s stated antipathy to the straight horizon line, the artist’s 1894 group of reductive Prout’s Neck watercolors focuses on the horizon as a locus of beauty. Accordingly, Homer started work on Sunshine and Shadow by making a tick mark in pencil at the center of the paper. He created the effect of the sun by leaving the bare white of the paper for the brightest areas of illumination. In contrast, heavy, gray-blue clouds throw their shadows over large expanses of dark water. The artist appears to have laid down his washes quickly and fluidly. The effect is contemplative and uplifting, yet it hints at a darker side of nature.",3486.0,"Artist

The Hellenistic period spans the nearly three hundred years between the death of Alexander the Great of
Macedonia (323 B.C.) and that of Cleopatra VII of Egypt (30 B.C.), a descendant of one of Alexander’s generals. The term Hellenistic is derived from Hellas, an ancient Greek word for Greece. It is used to describe both chronologically and culturally the era following Alexander’s conquest of Egypt and Asia, which resulted in the spread of Greek culture across a vast area. The melding of local and Greek artistic styles with the luxurious materials captured in the conquered lands resulted in magnificent artwork, including elegant coinage.",3498.0,"Culture
