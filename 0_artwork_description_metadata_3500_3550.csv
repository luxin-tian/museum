"Chous (Toy Pitcher), 400/380 BC, Ancient Greek","Toward the end of the 5th century B.C., Athenian potters and painters created a large number of miniature oinochoai (sing. oinochoe), or pitchers, decorated with children at play or imitating adults. It is thought that they were given to the youngest members of the family during the Anthesteria, a three-day celebration of the new vintage of wine and the arrival of spring. These little vessels are called choes (sing. chous), which means libations, after the name of the second day of the festival. Children took part in the festival but did not imbibe wine. On this example, a small white water bird has captured the unwanted attention of two naked toddlers. The boy on the left extends his toy pitcher toward it, while his companion bends over to touch it.",3503.0,"Culture

"Untitled (Yellow Sand Fountain), early 1950s, Joseph Cornell","In a dairy entry of September 1945, Cornell wrote, “one of the finest boxes (objects) ever made was worked out this day (completed or almost). The box of a white chamber effect with a ‘fountain‘ of green sand running. Shell, broken stem glass for receptacle” (Cornell 1993, p. 124). The Sand Fountain Boxes are perhaps the most difficult of Cornell‘s works to appreciate in reproduction, for the pleasure of looking is ideally complemented by the pleasure of handling the boxes and watching the changes of shape in the pouring sand. In Untitled (Yellow Sand Fountain), when the box is turned upside down, the yellow sand collects within the hollow, triangular birdhouse. As the box is righted, it then pours from the entrance hole onto the broken glass, cascading from the glass’s irregular edges onto the floor of the box. This work thus combines the symbolic resonance of the hourglass, whose sands measure the passage of time, with the idle fascination of watching something (like waves) in unpredictable but repetitive motion. To paraphrase Marcel Duchamp, when asked about his Bicycle Wheel (1913, original lost; see Pontus Hulten, ed., Marcel Duchamp: Work and Life, Cambridge, Mass., 1993, p. 30, ill.), the movement provides a useful distraction, like watching a fire in a grate. The comparison with an hourglass is interesting from a formal point of view as well: in the latter the movement of the sand is regulated by passing through the instrument‘s narrow waist; here, the space between the upper and lower containers is open; the glass, rather than containing and enclosing the sand, allows it to spill out, its broken and irregular edge causing the sand to flow unequally.",3516.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Yellow Sand Fountain), early 1950s, Joseph Cornell","The broken glass is one of several signs of age and decay in the box, which underline the notion of time passing. The interior of the box is painted white and is intentionally aged, possibly by baking, a practice Cornell is known to have used. There are wide horizontal and vertical cracks in the paint on the rear wall, and feathered cracks on the birdhouse. White paint flakes are mingled with the yellow sand, and it is difficult to determine whether the effects of aging have been more dramatic than intended at the outset. As noted in the above media description, the edges of the glass front show traces of newsprint and adhesive residue. This effect is “matched” by the weathering on the wood frame.",3516.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Yellow Sand Fountain), early 1950s, Joseph Cornell","A blue stain on the interior side of the glass front, which looks like an accidental drip and has possibly faded over the years, contributes to the impression of the passage of time and its chance operations. The faint trace of a watery blue underlines the in version of the idea of “fountain,” which here literally “runs dry.” The apparently accidental character of this stain should not mislead one in to overlooking both the visual complement it provides to the yellow of the sand, and the powerful associations the color blue had for Cornell. The artist in fact identified this color with the azure of the heavens, which he linked with the poetry of Emily Dickinson and Stephane Mallarme. The latter’s poem L’Azur (The Blue) indeed opens with the line, “The serene irony of the eternal azure” (my translation; for the complete text of this poem, see Mallarme: The Poems, bilingual edition tr. with intro. by Keith Bosley, Middlesex, 1977, pp. 86–89).",3516.0,"Artist

"Time, Death and Judgment, 1866, George Frederick Watts","George Frederick Watts exhibited this painting at the Royal Academy, London, in 1865 as Design for a Larger Picture. He later executed a number of versions of the same subject, which was identified by Mrs. Watts as Time bearing a scythe and pressing forward through the stream of life hand in hand with his mate, Death. The figure of Judgment follows behind, holding a sword. In the last half of his career, Watts, a celebrated Romantic painter, favored allegories like Time, Death, and Judgment, which were influenced by his studies of the heroic forms of the Renaissance artist Michelangelo and the warm palette of Titian.",3520.0,"Artist

"Bamboo, early 19th century, Kishi Ganku","In this bold study of bamboo rendered in monochrome ink against a solid ground of gold leaf, Kishi Ganku has captured the essence of the stalks with as few materials as possible. The screen on the right features the stalks of bamboo rising from the ground by a stream, while on the left we imagine the lofty upper reaches of the leaves beyond the top edge of the work.
Ganku rendered the sectional trunks of bamboo by loading the brush with ink and moving it evenly across the surface of the painting. In areas where the ink skipped across the non-absorbent gold or was mixed with animal glue, the results are naturalistic effects mimicking the bamboo’s texture or the play of light on its surface.",3527.0,"Artist

"The Coiffure, 1890–91, Mary Cassatt","As the current exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity demonstrates, women in the late 19th century were regularly defined by their attire. Clothing, makeup, and accessories frequently reflected not only a woman’s social status but also her character and morality. Scholar Justine De Young has observed of the period, “Dressing fashionably and in good taste thus became one of the central concerns of a bourgeois woman’s daily life, as not merely her appearance but also her reputation was at stake.” The same strict rules of public presentation did not necessarily apply, however, to the private, domestic sphere—as the images in this gallery illustrate. Shown here are women in the process of dressing or undressing; relaxing in their underclothes, nightgowns, or morning dress; or in the most private of moments: sleeping or reclining nude. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s print portfolio Elles most likely depicts prostitutes during the course of the day, but these prints could easily represent the interior life of any woman, as they illustrate common boudoir behaviors: the toilette, lounging in bed, grooming, and conversing with friends. Prints by Childe Hassam, Edvard Munch, James McNeill Whistler, and Paul Gavarni show women wearing peignoirs or dressing gowns. These garments were typically worn by upper class women while they went about their regular morning activities: attending to the servants or the children, catching up on reading and correspondence, and other routine household concerns.",3533.0,"Artist
