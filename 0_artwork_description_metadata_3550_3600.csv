"Torso of a Youth, 1st/2nd century AD, Ancient Roman","Greek masterpieces were copied early and often. The statues of the 4th-century B.C. Athenian sculptor Praxiteles were especially influential. His male figures were usually languid, youthful, and sensuous. The standing figures bore the body’s weight on one taut leg. The other, bent at the knee, was relaxed. The side of the body with the lowered hip had a higher shoulder, resulting in a pronounced S curve. The muscular yet supple body and the opposing diagonal lines of the hips and shoulders of this torso indicate that its sculptor followed Praxiteles’s principles. A swath of drapery across its back may have been draped in the front over one or both of the youth’s arms.",3550.0,"Culture

"Estimations, 1970/87, Vito Acconci","Transitioning from his work as a poet to visual art, from 1969 to 1970, Vito Acconci created a series of over 20 works combining photography and text that would, in his own words, “get myself off the page and into real space. These photographic pieces were ways to, literally, throw myself into my environment.” In both urban and natural landscapes, Acconci used a set of self-imposed instructions that described how to perform and document specific kinds of activities. In Estimations, his instructions and the results are listed along with the photographs. Here the artist explored the deceptive differences between reality, appearance, and representation. Acconci assembled this work in its present format 17 years after he captured the images.",3556.0,"Artist

"Wine Container, Shang dynasty ( About 1600–1046 BC ), 12th/11th century BC","The bronze vessels produced with sophisticated casting techniques and intricate designs by Chinese artisans of the late Shang dynasty (c. 1700-c. 1050 B.C.) are achievements unrivaled by any other Bronze Age culture. For the ruling elite of ancient China, prestigious objects made of bronze signified supreme political power as well as devout spiritual beliefs and exalted social status. Foremost among these bronzes are vessels that were made for the preparation and offering of food, wine, and water in ceremonial banquets conducted to seek and repay divine ancestral goodwill. Ancient Chinese wine was fermented from grain rather than fruit and, like beer, is best described as a type of millet ale.
This square-shouldered jar for wine storage is animated by a menagerie of imaginary creatures that have been intricately cast onto the surface in several levels of relief. The most prominent of these is a horned ogre mask (later known as a taotie), whose significance remains one of the great enigmas of early Chinese art. Here the taotie, inverted across the roof-like lid, recurs along the body within pendant triangular blades, each of which also contains a wide-eyed cicada at its tip. The cicada is found often on Chinese bronzes, perhaps because its extraordinarily long life cycle carried associations of regeneration. Confronted pairs of jaunty, stylized birds encircle the neck of the vessel, with similarly disposed dragons—each with down-curved head plume and up-curved tail around the widest part of the body. Birds and dragons are separated by a shoulder band of whorl circles, nose-diving dragons, and four fully sculpted bovine heads, two purely decorative and two surmounting lug handles. Two more such handles were cast on below to facilitate lifting. Compact, sharply cast spirals covering both the relief-cast taotie, dragons, and birds, and their receding background impart a shimmering effect to the surface, now covered with thin layers of cuprite red, malachite green, and azurite blue patina.",3557.0,"Title

"Mask for Egungun (Ere Egungun), Early/mid–20th century, Yoruba","This vibrantly colored Janus-faced mask reflects the diversity of Egungun masks of the Yoruba. The word egungun means masquerade, and these masks are used in Odun Egungun festivals, which are performed for ancestors throughout the Yoruba region. This mask’s elaborately grooved horns and central conical coiffure, which is painted blue, rise dramatically from the mask’s two faces. Two monkey figures once ran down the horns with front legs perched on the head, but one of the monkeys is now missing. The horns may signify its use as a hunter’s mask. Hunters are one of the few Yoruba social groups that are linked across different lineages and who have their own Egungun masqueraders.
While the costumes and rituals for Odun Egungun festivals are distinct and usually quite diverse within each region, these celebrations universally commemorate the ancestors who founded the lineage and continue to affect the daily existence of the living. Through rituals lasting several weeks, the masqueraders may visit lineage compounds to bless or punish their descendants.
The Egungun masquerade originated within the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo, perhaps as early as the 17th century, and spread to other corners of the Yoruba region over time. Today, many Yoruba communities have an Egungun society—made up of adult men and women who represent the community’s lineages—that plans the appearances of Egungun masqueraders at funerals or other special family occasions, as well as at yearly or biennial Egungun festivals. During these celebrations costumed men move through the town embodying the presence of their ancestors while songs are sung in their praise and invocations are offered to them. Though women and children participate by singing, dancing, and watching, they are kept at a safe distance from the masqueraders, whose actions are unpredictable.
Egungun masquerade costumes are commissioned and owned by men. The making of a costume involves close consultation with a tailor and sometimes a sculptor if a wood mask or headdress is required. It also necessitates the assistance of a diviner, who can communicate with the spirit world; an herbalist, who makes packets of protective medicines that are attached to the costume; and the leader of the Egungun society, who performs rituals to sanctify the costume and select the young man who will wear it while performing. Taking on the responsibility of owning a masquerade costume is demanding, but it also brings personal prestige and demonstrates a man’s commitment to his extended family, which is held in great esteem by the Yoruba.

"Rite, 1958, Philip Guston","In the 1930s, Philip Guston was involved with the mural movement and the work of Mexican artists such as Diego Rivera. On his arrival in New York in 1935–36, he joined the group of artists working for the Works Progress Administration’s Federal Arts Project. He spent the years after World War II developing a personal style that was inspired by both realist and abstract influences. By the early 1950s, he left representational imagery behind entirely, developing a lyrical Abstract Expressionist style that is typified by Rite. His paintings of this period largely consist of irregular blocks of gestural strokes and marks of color floating within the picture plane, often grouped toward the center of the composition. Guston’s most radical shift came in the late 1960s, when he confounded the art world with a new figurative style in which he used blunt cartoon shapes to create a personal iconography.",3563.0,"Artist

"Sacrifice to Priapus, the smaller plate, 1501/03, Jacopo de’ Barbari","The medical term priapism is derived from the name of the minor fertility god Priapus, whose permanently erect phallus is carefully washed in this sacrificial scene. Jacopo de’ Barbari also produced a larger engraving (1935.102 and 1956.999) in which the god’s phallus is obscured by smoke. The ceremonies depicted in these prints would have been intended to enhance the women’s fertility and their sons’ virility. The winged staff of Hermes doubles as the artist’s monogram in both prints; its placement on Priapus’s plinth may refer to the practice of erecting guideposts with Hermes’ portrait near roads to help lost travelers. Like the statue in this work, these pillars would have included sculpted, protruding genitalia, as in the Master of 1515’s engraving of Cleopatra (1951.374).",3566.0,"Artist

"Untitled #145, 1985, Cindy Sherman","Cindy Sherman’s staged photographs explore the pervasive effects of mass-media images on individual identities. Since the late 1970s, the artist has served as both photographer and model for a large cast of fictional personalities created primarily through costume, hair, makeup, and lighting. In 1985, after receiving an invitation from Vanity Fair to contribute photographs based on fairy tales, Sherman began making disturbing, gruesome images, such as Untitled #145, that counter the happily-ever-after bedtime stories associated with the genre. Instead, she captured narratives filled with anxiety and implied violence, explaining, “In horror stories or in fairy tales, the fascination with the morbid is also, at least for me, a way to prepare for the unthinkable… . That’s why it’s very important for me to show the artificiality of it all.”",3568.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire, 1912–20, Louis Casimir Ladislas Marcoussis","Apollinaire (Wilhelm Apollinaris de Kostrowitzky,1880- 1918), a poet of illegitimate birth and mixed Polish and Italian ancestry, settled in Paris and began signing his poems Guillaume Apollinaire in 1903. He mixed with a circle of artists and writers that included Picasso and the author Alfred Jarry (1873-1907), and became the lover of the painter Marie Laurencin (1885-1956). He edited a number of reviews, published satirical and semi-porno­ graphic texts, and proclaimed that the writings of the Marquis de Sade would dominate the 20th century. In 1918, Apollinaire died from wounds he suffered during the First World War. His stature as a forerunner of Surre­alism continued to grow after his death, largely due to the intense eroticism and highly original verbal and typographical styles that are the hallmarks of his work (see his Calligrammes, Paris, 1918).",3580.0,"Artist

"Saint Catherine, c. 1520, Jean Bellegambe","Jean Bellegambe worked in Douai, in a part of northern France that was once part of the county of Flanders. These panels are the wings of a triptych, a three-paneled folding altarpiece, whose center (now in the Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels) shows the Virgin and Child enthroned under an elaborate architectural canopy. The two elegant saints are identifiable by their attributes: for Catherine, the wheel upon which she was tortured and the sword with which she was martyred; and for Barbara, the tower where her father locked her up to keep her safe from suitors. Saint Catherine also holds a ring, which the Christ Child in the Brussels panel reaches to grasp, thus indicating that their mystical union was the subject of the triptych. The tops of the two wings have been rounded off to mask their original function as moveable shutters to the left and right of the center panel. The backs and fronts of the wings were also separated; the backs of the wings, showing the Annunciation when the triptych was closed, are now in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore.",3581.0,"Artist

The crowning peacock feathers are an armorial augmentation bestowed on the family by Emperor Charles V in 1530. They prove that the famous Albrecht Dürer, who died in 1528, did not create the print. Indeed, the Nuremberg Kress family likely commissioned this ephemeral shield from one of his followers. The print was meant to be painted; the Kress heraldic colors included red, silver, and black. The dagger superimposed on the main shield would have been particularly striking against a rich red and silver filigreed backdrop.",3588.0,"Artist

"Lions on the Dreyfus Fund III, 1964, Larry Rivers","Trained as a jazz saxophonist, Larry Rivers discovered a parallel in and an innate talent for painting early on as well. Equally cerebral, sentimental, and provocative, he is considered a key proto-Pop artist—bridging the gap between the painterly gestures of Abstract Expressionism, dominant during the 1950s, and Pop Art’s pointed return to figuration during the 1960s. Rivers was at the height of his renown by 1964, having introduced found objects and imagery, including stencils and other forms of lettering, into his canvases. The composition of Lions on the Dreyfus Fund III is at once complex and diffuse: striding lions, jostling letters, floating tails, and muscular brushstrokes achieve a lateral push and pull. Through its title and its legible content this work refers to the Dreyfus Fund, a mutual fund broker that has featured lions prominently in its advertisements and corporate logo.",3592.0,"Artist
