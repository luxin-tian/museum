"One at the Time, 2003, Michael Borremans","Michaël Borremans’s mysterious, often discomfiting images of self-absorbed subjects in indeterminate settings are inspired by photographs, film, magazines, and illustrated books. Although the aesthetics of these pictorial sources seep into his work—the coloration, hairstyles, and clothing recall the 1930s and 1940s—Borremans’s paintings ultimately lack a clear narrative. While his characters appear engaged in actions that require meticulous attention, more often than not the paintings offer little indication of what preoccupies them. Borremans explained, “A painting is not just an image: it is an object with a multi-layered character."" One at the Time is one of several works in which figures in white lab coats attend to flat surfaces. Rife with psychological overtones and ambiguity, two men and a woman stare at a cloth-covered table on which three white shelves seem to be floating.",3600.0,"Artist

"The Adoration of the Magi, 1515/25, Follower of Lucas van Leyden","The half-length format of this jewel-like painting makes the subject of the adoration of the Christ Child accessible, while the departure of the magi and their exotic followers enlivens the rocky landscape of the background. This picture was probably made for the market of discriminating private collectors just developing in the Low Countries in the early 16th century. Cornelis Engebrechtsz. worked in the northern city of Leiden but apparently made this small painting for export and sale in the more cosmopolitan southern provinces of the Netherlands, then the center of the emerging art market. Its design was copied in several paintings and illuminations made in Bruges.",3601.0,"Artist

Liu Center in the Chinatown neighborhood of Chicago serves the community with a focus on health, education, and social support. When approached to submit a design for the new center, Jeanne Gang found subtle ways to incorporate welcoming traditional Chinese colors and signs within a modern, airy space. The small construction budget did not limit the expressive qualities of the building, including a richly detailed lattice sunscreen and shimmering titanium shingles cladding the exterior. The identity of the building is defined by the diversity of its users, and the flexibility of programming in many of the interior spaces promotes intergenerational and international communication.",3602.0,"Artist

"The Monk in the Cornfield, c. 1646, Rembrandt van Rijn","Rembrandt was never shy about showing naked bodies or erotic subjects in a realistic way. In the 1640s he created several scenes of courting couples outdoors, and The Monk in the Cornfield is one of the most sexually charged of these prints. Despite the print’s tiny size, the graphic depiction of an unchaste monk and an enthusiastic milkmaid coupling surreptitiously makes for a powerful sculptural grouping. The etched suggestion of a farmer with a scythe in the background reinforces the temporary nature of their haven in the wheat field and emphasizes the voyeurism of the viewer.",3605.0,"Artist

As evidenced by his photograph of the model Tanja Ramm, studio work afforded him room to experiment. Man Ray made a series of views of Ramm that departed from his more conservative portraits by incorporating solarization, one of his signature darkroom techniques, which involved exposing developed but unfixed negatives to additional light. The success of this photograph led him to employ the technique for future portraits, including those of painter Giorgio de Chirico and Surrealist writer André Breton.",3607.0,"Artist

"“monument” for V. Tatlin, 1964, Dan Flavin","Dan Flavin began creating sculptural objects from commercially available fluorescent-light fixtures in 1963. In the decades that followed, he made systematic arrangements of fluorescent-light tubes in ever-larger environments, exploring ways to activate architectural space through the diffusion of light and color. Rather than titling his works, Flavin often dedicated them to friends and artists he admired. The most famous of these include his Monuments for Tatlin, an ongoing homage to the Russian Constructivist sculptor Vladamir Tatlin (1885–1953), who dreamed of combining artistry and engineering. Attached to the wall and arranged vertically into a relief sculpture, the seven white fluorescent tubes here evoke Tatlin’s Monument to theThird International (1920), a spiral tower he designed but never realized.",3613.0,"Artist

Certain features of this head are shared with other Buddhist icons: the concave forehead circle (urna) is an auspicious mark from which wisdom radiates; the elongated earlobes allude to the aristocratic Indian custom of wearing heavy earrings, and thereby to the Buddha’s early life as an Indian prince.",3618.0,"Title

Both pastels retain their original Rococo-style frames. They may have been carved by the Boston cratsman John Welch, who created many of Copley’s Rococo frames, the type the artist used most frequently for his American portraits. The frame on Mrs. Henry Hill was gilded, as this was generally appropriate for the Rococo style; however, recent scholarship has revealed that a few Copley frames, like that of Henry Hill, were painted black. Thus, these portraits present two different ways that Copley’s frames might have been finished.",3627.0,"Artist

"Pocahontas, 1868, Joseph Mozier","Between 1848 and 1870, Joseph Mozier carved several depictions of Pocahontas, a subject of great popularity in 19th-century America. Born around 1595, Pocahontas achieved legendary status for saving the life of Captain John Smith, an English explorer, in 1608. Taken to the Jamestown settlement, she converted to Christianity and was baptized with the name Rebecca. Mozier’s sculpture depicts the moment of Pocahontas’s spiritual conversion. For Mozier, Pocahontas’s acceptance of the Christian faith signaled the superiority of Western civilization over the native culture. By showing Pocahontas alone, Mozier related the sculpture to the 19th-century desire to view her as a child of nature, whose Christianity came from within rather than through European contact.",3630.0,"Artist

"A Word Made Flesh…Throat, 1994, Lesley Dill","Lesley Dill, whose father was a beloved teacher despite suffering from schizophrenia, and whose mother was a speech and theater instructor, grew up hyper aware of the importance of language. Not surprisingly, she was an English major in college, and it was during that period that her mother gave her the collected works of Emily Dickinson—which proved to be perhaps Dill’s most significant influence. Almost all of Dill’s works contain words, and frequently they are those of Dickinson. Dill has said, “I think of words, and especially the poems of Emily Dickinson, for their embodiment of psychological states of despair and euphoria as metaphors for being, as a kind of spiritual armor, and intervening skin between ourselves and the world.” A Word Made Flesh, a series of four mixed-process prints literally transcribes the words of Dickinson onto a woman’s body. While the text is legible in Back and Throat, Dill has manipulated the language within the ghostly composition of Front to the point where only select phrases are visible: “ghastly” over the woman’s chest and “cares” (short for caress) over her stomach for example. In this series, word and image merge with forceful, yet disturbingly vulnerable, effect.",3638.0,"Artist

Homer rendered the light from the setting sun with pale pink and orange washes, seen in the sky and reflected in the water. Foliage in the background and at the right side of the image is depicted abstractly, adding to the scene’s hazy atmosphere. This area shows signs of overwork, where Homer repeatedly removed and added color as he sought to soften the contours of the landscape, as if enveloped in the mist of evening.
