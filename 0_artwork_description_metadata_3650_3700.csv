"Prout’s Neck, Breaking Wave, 1887, Winslow Homer","Philip Beam has identified the site for Prout’s Neck, Breaking Wave as “the shoreline a little above water’s edge in the vicinity of Cannon Rock, looking toward High Cliff,” adding that Homer “fished from this point almost daily during the summer and fall and must have seen such waves ""a thousand times"" (Beam 1966, n.p.). Homer’s familiarity with the site is born out by the techniques that he used to capture the relentless churning movement of the massive wave. Although he used very little graphite in this work, he mapped out the frothy whites of the wave by making staccato marks with resist, probably using chalk for this purpose. Homer used almost every trick he knew to achieve the varied textures of water, shore, and sky, including layering, blotting, rewetting, and scraping. Although carefully planned and carried out, the final effect is vigorous and immediate.",3651.0,"Artist

"Marina City, Chicago, Illinois, Perspective Looking West, 1985, Bertrand Goldberg","Bertrand Goldberg’s design for Marina City (1959-67) had a lasting impact on Chicago urbanism and provided a virtually unrivaled contribution to the cultural imagination of the mid-century world. The novel mixed-use development was designed to produce a microcosm of the urban landscape or, “a City with a City,” with a lively 24-hour cycle of living, work, and play in the apartment towers, commercial areas, office and theater buildings. An expressive sketch of the complex illustrates a variety of geometries from rounded tower “petals” to a recessed rectangular ice-skating rink. This drawing was created in 1985 when Goldberg was asked to consult on renovations to the plaza level of the complex.",3654.0,"Artist

"“Germantown Eyedazzler” Rug, c. 1800/90, Navajo (Diné)","Brillant color and bold overall patterns with serrated diamonds, chevrons, and interlocking lines are hallmarks of the ""Eye Dazzler"" style of Navajo (Diné) textiles produced from the late-19th to the early-20th century. Earlier Navajo blankets featured broad horizontal bands of indigo blue, white, dark brown, black, and red, subsequently enhanced with the addition of small diamonds, bars, and squares. The lively approach of Eye Dazzler weaving developed out of a period of major cultural and artistic transformation beginning in 1864 when the U.S. government forcefully resettled the Navajo in the Bosque Redondo reservation. From the early 1860s, the Navajo received brightly colored commercial yarns as part of their U.S. government annuities. The new Eye Dazzler weaving also incorporated design elements characteristic of Mexican Saltillo blankets, which featured serrated diamonds and zigzag lines.",3656.0,"Culture

Although it may appear simple at first look, this panel is far more elaborate than meets the eye: the geometric designs presented here were formed using multiple techniques, with the weaving of the blue and red half-step frets, the outlining in white embroidery, and the edging in cross-knit loop stitches. This pattern creates an overall checkerboard of color, with the juxtaposed colored surfaces further combining to create full-step frets.",3659.0,"Culture

"Battle of the Naked Men, 1470/75, Antonio Pollaiuolo","The 15th-century Florentine goldsmith, printer, and painter Antonio Pollaiuolo frequently posed figures in alternating views, possibly copying a sculpted model from several directions. The subject of this famous print—one of the earliest and largest Italian engravings—has never been fully understood, nor the specific battle identified. But Pollaiuolo may have based this work on a sculpture unearthed in Rome in 1488, the Statuary Group of Three Satyrs Fighting a Serpent. The pained expression of the nude on the ground at right closely resembles the fallen satyr, suggesting a direct quotation from sculpture into print.",3661.0,"Artist

"Male Nude, January 29, 1880, Gustav Klimt","Life drawing from the nude was an integral part of the rigorous academic training an artist might traditionally receive in Paris and other major cities in the 19th century. Only after beginning with rote copying from prints and plaster casts after the antique would qualified, usually male, students progress to the nude model. The highly finished drawings that resulted from these sessions hearken back to Classical sculpture in their definition of relief and generally demonstrate more the respective technical aptitude of these young artists than their creative potential. Paul Cézanne and Gustav Klimt’s nudes are particularly difficult to recognize as autograph, although they underline the dramatic journey made by these artists to their mature styles. Luminous in surface handling and a tendency toward allegory, Edward Burne-Jones’ sketchbook nudes are less rigorous in their anatomical detail, while Auguste Rodin’s cropped female form floats across the page as an ode to the theme of eternal feminine. Conversely, the subject of Gustave Courbet’s Model Reading exhibits partial undress rather than complete nudity in a moment of quiet introspection between her modeling sessions.",3663.0,"Artist

"Male Nude, January 29, 1880, Gustav Klimt","The diminishing influence of the Academy, and its advocacy of realistic painting, infused a short-lived periodical, Le nu esthètique (The aesthetic nude). Produced shortly after the emergence of photography helped nudge painting toward greater abstraction, this publication offered decoratively laid-out photographs of female, male, and child nudes in varying poses and allegorical guises, purportedly for artists to study from life. No corresponding paintings are known, but the ultimate academician Jean-Léon Gerôme’s introduction suggests its audience was intended to be a new generation of academic painters.",3663.0,"Artist

"Carpet, 1887, William Morris","The design and craftsmanship of decorative objects were of the utmost importance to Morris. His dedicated interest in understanding, practicing, and mastering textile-manufacturing techniques, coupled with his belief in the benefits of beauty in everyday life, made him and his firm among the most celebrated in British history. In the 1870s Morris began designing hand-knotted and machine-made carpets. He had long been interested in historical carpets, and many could be found in his personal collection. Here Morris looked to Turkish and Persian rugs for inspiration, utilizing a layout with a central medallion set in a field of interlacing stylized flowers and foliage framed by a border of continuous palmettes.",3671.0,"Artist

Egyptian gods were commonly depicted with human bodies and animal heads. The animal referred to the god’s personality or characteristics, not his or her appearance. For example, the crocodile head of Sobek alludes to his fierceness. The Greeks and Romans took these mixed forms literally rather than symbolically, and some Classical authors, accustomed to gods in human form, derided the Egyptians for their “ridiculous” gods, dismissing them as “dog-faced Egyptians, dressed up in linen.” Statuettes like these were offered to the gods to ask for their help or in thanks for their assistance.",3680.0,"Culture

All of them were deeply etched on iron plates and share an idiosyncratic solarizing effect created by the artist’s reversal of the usual relationship of light and dark. He stopped out the areas that were to remain white before immersing the plates in acid, with the result that his figures glow, almost as if they too were part of a window.
