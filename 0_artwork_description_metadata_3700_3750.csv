"Statue of a Young Boy, 1st century AD, Ancient Roman","Representations of children were popular in both public and private art during the Roman imperial period. It is uncertain whether this statue is a portrait of a specific child or was inspired by a basic type that had originated among the Greeks several centuries earlier. The boy, who has a head of curly hair, rounded cheeks, and a pudgy belly, gazes downward and to the side. It is possible that he is admiring a pet at his feet, as Roman statues of children frequently depict them with companion animals such as geese, doves, and puppies.",3713.0,"Culture

"The Lone Boat, North Woods Club, Adirondacks, 1892, Winslow Homer","The Lone Boat, North Woods Club, Adirondacks speaks powerfully of the fisherman’s communion with nature. The medium of watercolor offered the perfect metaphor as well as technical means to express this relationship; its very wetness allows the forms of man and nature to run together, absorbed by the hazy atmosphere. In The Lone Boat, Homer constructed a nearly abstract composition along a strong horizon line, with the trees on the shore and their reflections in the water forming a symmetrical design. The effect is similar to that achieved when a still-wet sheet is folded at the center and blotted.",3718.0,"Artist

"Special Houses, from The Black Woman (formerly The Negro Woman) (published 1946-47), 1946, printed 1989, Elizabeth Catlett","The I Am the Black Woman series (previously called Negro Women) is composed of 15 linocuts accompanied by explanatory titles and texts. The series celebrates the courage and determination of female heroines of African American history, as well as the valor, integrity, and resolve of ordinary women. The Art Institute’s three prints from the series focus on the daily struggles of African American women. Aesthetically, the entire series is characterized by an emphasis on figural simplicity. A palpable sense of movement and a lack of excessive detail are visible throughout the series. This print, Special Houses, addresses the issue of segregated housing and the experiences of African Americans in crowded northern cities.",3720.0,"Artist

"Africa Restored (Cheryl as Cleopatra), 2003, Kerry James Marshall","Kerry James Marshall describes Africa Restored (Cheryl as Cleopatra) as “the shape of Africa reconfigured as a
cubist sculpture.” Reversing art-historical narratives of modernist painting’s appropriation of African sculpture, it offers a complex meditation on African ancestry and black aesthetics. Africa Restored formally references the nkisi nkondi, or power figures, of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These sculptures were crafted as basic armatures into which accretions of metals, mirrors, and nails were driven to activate their force. Affixed to the sculpture are “medallions,” or “icons,” in the form of photographic images and texts laminated in plastic that refer to both prominent and lesser-known figures within the black freedom movement in America as well as
to Egyptian iconographies adopted by African Americans in the 1970s as a way to challenge dominant Western worldviews. In producing his speculative history of Africa and its diaspora, Marshall also casts his contemporaries as stars in his constellation of references—for example, the artist’s wife, artist and actor Cheryl Lynn Bruce, performs as Cleopatra. Notably, Marshall adds new elements each time the sculpture goes on view, including for this current presentation. Thus, the work can be seen as an unfinished, living sculpture—open to continued revision by the artist.",3726.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1964, Mark Tobey","Untitled effectively embodies its maker’s goal of melding Eastern calligraphy and Western drawing. Mark Tobey studied brushwork in China and Japan, where he lived for a while in a Zen monastery. Around 1935 Tobey arrived at his distinctive “white writing,” or intricate networks of calligraphic marks that densely and evenly animate a surface. When viewed from a distance, these dabs and dashes of pigment interspersed with short, overlapping lines—create a writhing, unified field of energy. In Untitled the subdued palette of lavender, white, gray, black, and burgundy functions similarly—the innumerable strokes and marks only become distinct from close-up. A smoothly painted border, which appears in much of Tobey’s oeuvre, surrounds and offsets the vibrating center. The artist felt that his delicate, teeming webs of “living line” mirrored the connections between East and West, finite and infinite, humanity and the cosmos.",3731.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Homage to Blériot), 1956, Joseph Cornell","This box is an example of Cornell‘s ability to convey ideas and associations by minimal means. A construction of thin pieces of wood is delicately balanced from the center of the metal spring coil, on which it bounces freely. The arrangement hints at the wings and propeller of a biplane, thus relating to the title, which in earlier exhibitions was listed simply as Bleriot. Louis Bleriot (1872-1936) was a pioneering French aviator, the first to fly across the English Channel in 1909. The strongly marked wood grain, stained pale blue, of the inner wall of the box evokes both the waves of the sea, over which early planes flew low, as well as perhaps clouds in the sky. Cornell papered the back of the box with a French newspaper, L’Economiste francais (June 15, 1893). Given the subject of this box, the choice of paper backing—always an integral part of a box’s construction for the artist—seems not entirely fortuitous. Another, closely related box, referred to as Bleriot # 2, has been dated around 1956 (estate of Joseph Cornell; New York 1980–82, no. 115, ill.). It differs from this one primarily in the relationship of the components within the box.",3738.0,"Artist

"Self-Portrait, c. 1725, Nicolas de Largillière","Nicolas de Largillière was among the most highly esteemed and prolific portrait painters working in the time of Louis XIV of France, and his popularity continued through the period of the regency that followed Louis’s death in 1715. His portraits were admired for their deftly rendered textures and for the confident poses that lent a sense of grandeur and ease to the sitters. They were sought after by a diverse clientele, ranging from royalty and courtiers to the upper middle class. In this work, one of his many self-portraits, Largillière presented himself as fashionably dressed and self-assured, the master of his art. He depicted himself as ready to lay out a painting, working with a porte-crayon (a piece of chalk in a holder) on the blank canvas behind him.",3742.0,"Artist

"Panel (Furnishing Fabric), 1761, Robert Jones","The historical significance of this panel comes not from its representation but from its precise documentation in textile history. It is one of the earliest examples using copper plate printing, signed and dated in the plate in two places. the pastoral scene is from an etching by Nicholas Berchem (1620- 1683), dating from 1652; the peacock and poultry still life can be traced to an engraving by Josephus Sympson (1710- 1750) published in London in 1740, after a painting by Marmaduke Cradock (1660- 1717). The columns are emblematic of the classical- revival style favored at the time and the stag and dog motifs can be traced to the volume entitled ""Animals of Various Species Accurately Drawn"" by Francis Barlow (1626- 1702).",3747.0,"Artist
