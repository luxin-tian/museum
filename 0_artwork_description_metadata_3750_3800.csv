"Breaking Waves, September Tide, 1901, Louis Auguste Lepère","Louis-Auguste Lepére began his career as a commercial wood engraver, but in 1885 he decided to begin making his own original woodcuts. Moved by Japanese prints exhibited at the 1888 Exposition Internationale de Blanc et Noir and the 1889 Exposition Universelle, Lepére experimented with the color woodcut process. Breaking Waves pays homage to the ocean imagery popular in the islands of Japan and integrates a diagonally recessed shoreline with a horizon line just above the center elements that find a counterpart in Utagawa Hiroshige’s Hamamatsu.",3750.0,"Artist

"Cape Split, Maine, 1941, John Marin","In this work, blue and pink lines hover above the horizon, indicating fair weather for both sailing and painting. Marin evoked the complexity of the surf with a wide range of paint applications: dry brushstrokes for the water’s texture; intervals of wet-into-wet; amorphous washes to suggest foreground rocks; pale blue tints over white paper for sea foam; and multiple shades of black, blue, and green to evoke depth and movement below the waves. He then used pencil to delineate the rock forms, applying watercolor over graphite and vice versa.",3755.0,"Artist

"Prout’s Neck, Evening, c. 1894, Winslow Homer","Although undated, Prout’s Neck, Evening probably belongs to a group of unusually reductive watercolors Homer painted in Maine in 1894. In its near abstraction and reliance on subtle color gradations, this watercolor and others in this group suggest that Homer may have looked closely at traditional Japanese ink paintings. Tranquil in mood, the image is divided nearly in half by the horizon line, with the gray-blue sea and sky reflecting each other, separated only by bare white paper and a wet wash of bright blue along the horizon. Homer emphasized the calm sea by applying color in broad, even washes.
Laying a flat wash is a fundamental technique for depicting sky and water in a landscape painting. After crossing the length of the sheet with his brush, which is loaded with color, the painter starts back in the other direction, touching the top of the brush to the bottom of the previous stroke so the wet washes merge evenly. Controlled speed is essential: if the first stroke is allowed to dry, a hard line appears and the strokes will not blend. Once the wash dries, subsequent washes can be laid over it, which is how Homer built up tone in the sea.",3756.0,"Artist

"A Child’s Grave, Hale County, Alabama, 1936, Walker Evans","Walker Evans perfected a dispassionate documentary approach to photography that was concise yet often poetic. Among his best known pictures are those he made on a 1936 trip to Hale County, Alabama, with writer James Agee, to record the lives of three impoverished tenant farmer families during the Depression. Evans’s photographs and Agee’s lengthy text were eventually published as the 1941 book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. Agee devoted a short chapter to a local graveyard, noting the improvised nature of markers on the poorest of the burial sites, including pine boards, glasses, and old crockery. Evans photographed several such graves (a different image than this was included in the book); in this picture, he dramatically cropped the print from a full negative in order to echo the horizontal shape of the grave itself, underscoring with little flourish the poignant nature of his subject.",3757.0,"Artist

Here houses are not domestic spaces, but rather spectacles of destruction. The homes are emptied, destroyed, and stripped of their facades, appearing as they would have to residents returning following World War I. The Battle of Arras lasted from April 9 to May 16, 1917; during that time, Allied troops pushed Germans east from the French town in the Artois region of northern France. It was during the Battle of Arras that the fight for the Vimy Ridge took place. Though the battle lasted for a little over a month, Arras was continually bombarded for four years, and, among the cities of France, the damage inflicted was second only to that faced by Rheims.",3758.0,"Artist

"Christ before Pilate, 1500/05, Giovanni Antonio da Brescia","Giovanni Antonio da Brescia’s unusually large engraving Christ before Pilate recalls relief sculptures from the sides of Roman sarcophagi. The darkly crosshatched background creates a shallow depth of field and unifies the figural frieze. Pilate’s elevated placement and pointing finger emphasize his authoritative demeanor. The biblical text beneath his seat proclaims his unrealized intention to set Christ free; indeed, his captive’s foot seems to emerge from the picture plane. Da Brescia placed the line of sight below the horizon, creating the illusion of looking up for the viewer and thus increasing the image’s sense of monumentality.",3762.0,"Artist

"Ho-Mo-Vi, 1898, Elbridge Ayer Burbank","In 1897 the Chicago artist Elbridge Ayer Burbank traveled west on behalf of his uncle, the philanthropist Edward E. Ayer, to paint a portrait of the famed Apache chief Geronimo, who was then living in captivity at Fort Sill in the Oklahoma territory. During his subsequent travels throughout the West, Burbank depicted individuals from numerous Native American tribes in ethnographic portraits, nevertheless focusing a sensitive artistic eye on his sitters. Like Hermon Atkins MacNeil before him, Burbank witnessed the Hopi Snake Dance in Arizona and followed the dance’s nine-day progress, ultimately producing more than 19 paintings of the participants. The Art Institute owns eight of these portraits. Each element of paint and dress carries a specific meaning in Burbank’s portraits. In his depictions of the Hopi priests Ko-Pe-Ley and Ho-Mo-Vi, for example, the black paint on the upper parts of their faces represents heavy rain clouds, and the white around their mouths stands for purity and faith. Eagle feathers, used in the ceremony to soothe the snakes, adorn their hair. Thus costumed, the priests would have removed the snakes from a special bag and placed the reptiles crosswise in their mouths. Despite his slightly loose brushwork, Burbank carefully depicted the priests’ ceremonial garb, giving his images anthropological authenticity as well as aesthetic power. He inscribed each portrait with the sitter’s name and tribal affiliation, using ""Moqui,"" an obsolete term for the Hopi people that is now considered offensive.",3770.0,"Artist

"Untitled, c. 1940, László Moholy-Nagy","An artist who worked in many media, László Moholy-Nagy was hired to lead Chicago’s New Bauhaus, a school based on Bauhaus principles, in 1937. Photography was only one part of a curriculum that integrated art, industry, and society, but it was a key element; as Moholy wrote, “The illiterate of the future will be ignorant of the camera and the pen alike.” Central to his understanding of photography was the photogram, an image made by placing objects or casting shadows directly on photographic paper and exposing the arrangement to light. To Moholy, the photogram was the perfect teaching tool because it demonstrated the medium’s complete tonal range and revealed photography’s essence to be its sensitivity to light. This image, dedicated to George Barford, another instructor at the school, may have been a collaborative effort in the darkroom or a teaching example for the classroom.",3771.0,"Artist

The Hellenistic period spans the nearly three hundred years between the death of Alexander the Great of
Macedonia (323 B.C.) and that of Cleopatra VII of Egypt (30 B.C.), a descendant of one of Alexander’s generals. The term Hellenistic is derived from Hellas, an ancient Greek word for Greece. It is used to describe both chronologically and culturally the era following Alexander’s conquest of Egypt and Asia, which resulted in the spread of Greek culture across a vast area. The melding of local and Greek artistic styles with the luxurious materials captured in the conquered lands resulted in magnificent artwork, including elegant coinage.",3773.0,"Culture

Lysimachus (r. 323–281 B.C.), the general who succeeded Alexander as the ruler of Thrace, used the young ruler’s portrait on the front of this coin. However, on the back Lysimachus named himself “king” and pictured the goddesses Athena and Nike (Victory) crowning his name with laurels, which symbolized victory or honor. He also placed his personal badge—a lion’s fore-parts—under Athena’s hand.

"Gold Pectoral with Zoomorphic Face, c. 500 B.C., Chavín","The archaeological site of Chavín de Huántar, high in a valley in the northern Andes of Peru, was a seat of economic, political, and religious power, giving rise to art and symbolic imagery that deeply affected the Andean world between 900 and 200 B.c.1 The rulers of Chavín brought about a cultural synthesis, adapting architectural and sculptural forms that had been associated with ruler-ship by the urban coastal societies of Peru for at least a thousand years. Artists created a new imagery, deriving forms from both the human figure and dominant predators—caymans, harpy eagles, jaguars, and pumas, some of them native to the Amazon forests east of the Andes mountains. These animal and anthropomorphic icons were often combined in a fearsome visual vocabulary. Expressed in imposing architectural reliefs, monumental three-dimensional sculptures, textile designs, and splendid ritual attire and portable objects, this symbolic imagery was emblematic of Chavín priestly rulers and the warrior aristocracy, affirming their spiritual connections with the domain of animal powers and the deified forces and phenomena of nature. Chavín art was a distinctly Andean expression of the cosmological and religious worldview that once held sway throughout the Americas.
This pectoral is a rare example of the attire worn by a Chavín leader on ceremonial occasions. Metallurgy was well developed in the Andes; to make this object, an artisan would first have cut a hammered sheet of gold and copper alloy into a rectangular shape, with four ""arms"" extending at the corners in a cruciform pattern; then he used a sharp instrument to engrave the design of the mask and the ornamental curls and linear appendages; the sculptural low relief was achieved by hammering the metal over a carved wooden mold. The menacing face with its zigzag eyebrows, bulbous nose, and fanged, grinning mouth is an iconic type found on gold work, stone monuments, textiles, and ceramic vessels. Many objects of Chavín gold work are found in broken condition: the deliberate damage done to this piece was undoubtedly inflicted when it was ritually ""killed"" for burial and sent to accompany its wearer on his journey to the world of the ancestor spirits.

"The Eagle, the Arrow, and the Dolphin, c. 1960, Joseph Cornell","The title of this box refers to a small section of a map of the heavens attached to the top of the box’s interior left wall. It reproduces several constellations with their Latin names, including AQUl(LA) (Eagle), SAGITTA (Arrow), and DELPHINUS (Dolphin). Cornell used the larger illustration attached to the box’s interior back wall, showing a group of constellations labeled CEPHEUS, URSA MINOR, DRACO, and CAUDA DRACONIS, in several other boxes, including Pavilion. The original image appears to have been photographically reproduced, and then partially colored in by hand by Cornell himself. The artist used it again in Cauda Draconis of 1958 (New York, Xavier Fourcade, Inc.; Waldman 1977, pl. 33), a box that offers a close comparison to The Eagle, the Arrow, and the Dolphin. Both boxes are horizontal in their construction and include metal rods supporting a rolling ball.

"The Eagle, the Arrow, and the Dolphin, c. 1960, Joseph Cornell","The study of the constellations had many layers of significance for the artist Constellations were connected to ancient mythology and bore witness to the power of the human imagination to imprint images and patterns on chaos. The illustration pasted into these boxes exemplifies these aspects in its particularly pleasing combination of science and fantasy. Cornell associated favorite constellations, such as Andromeda, Orion, and the Dragon, with friends, film stars, or ballerinas. The very term “ constellation” took on a particular significance for him in his effort to understand and describe his working process, as he sought patterns in his experiences, his feelings, and his works. A handwritten note in his diary reads: “What about ‘constellations’ for experiments in going over past experiences on various subjects and picking out certain points for a presentation” (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1060; see Cornell 1993, p. 227).",3792.0,"Artist
