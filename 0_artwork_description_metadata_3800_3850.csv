"Deportation to Death (Death Train), 1942, Leopoldo Méndez","With more than two dozen illustrations by 11 artists of the Taller de Gráfica Popular, The Black Book of Nazi Terror in Europe (1943) was the group’s most important antifascist collaboration with the European exile community in Mexico. Supported by the government of Manuel Ávila Camacho, this groundbreaking book extensively documented Nazi atrocities through testimonies, statistics, photographs, and illustrations, with contributions by well-known European, American, and Latin American writers and artists. Many of the Taller’s illustrations were also produced as individual prints, including the three displayed here. Méndez’s Deportation to Death is perhaps the earliest print related to the Holocaust and the death camps. While Méndez’s print focuses on the deportation of Jews from Europe’s ghettos, their humble clothing and pained countenances revealed in expressionistic fashion by the Nazi soldier’s lamp, Mallary’s This Is the New Nazi Order suggests the breadth of the fascist threat by the inclusion of a large crucifix around the neck of one of the hanged men.",3805.0,"Artist

El libro negro del terror nazi en Europa El libro negro del terror nazi en Europa (1943) constituyó la colaboración antifascista más importante del Taller de Gráfica Popular con la comunidad europea exiliada en México. En él se incluyeron más de dos docenas de ilustraciones realizadas por once de sus miembros. Con el apoyo del gobierno de Manuel Ávila Camacho, este emblemático libro documenta ampliamente las atrocidades nazis a través de testimonios, estadísticas, fotografías e ilustraciones, y mediante contribuciones de afamados artistas y escritores europeos, estadounidenses y latinoamericanos. Muchas de las ilustraciones del Taller fueron también publicadas como grabados sueltos, entre ellos los tres que se muestran aquí. Deportación a la muerte de Méndez es quizás el primer grabado sobre el tema del Holocausto y los campos de exterminio. Mientras el grabado de Méndez se concentra en la deportación de los judíos residentes en los guetos europeos, cuyas ropas humildes y rostros sufrientes quedan descubiertos a la manera expresionista bajo la luz de la lámpara del soldado nazi, la pieza Así es el nuevo orden nazi, de Robert Mallary, sugiere el amplio espectro de la amenaza fascista mediante la visualización de un gran crucifijo alrededor del cuello de uno de los hombres ahorcados.",3805.0,"Artist

"Linguist Staff with Rooster and Hen (Okyeame Poma), Early/mid–20th century, Asante","The Asante kingdom was the most powerful of numerous states that emerged at the beginning of the 15th century within the present-day country of Ghana. The kingdom’s position between the rich gold fields of the north and the coast, where European ships vied for trade, assured its wealth and maintained its focus on gold as a symbol of affluence and power. Asante art is often related to oral traditions, including messages expressed through proverbs, sayings, or accounts of history. Staffs with decorative finials like this one bearing the figures of a rooster and hen are owned by the official spokesman, or linguist, of an Asante chief as symbols of his office.",3812.0,"Culture

"Linguist Staff with Rooster and Hen (Okyeame Poma), Early/mid–20th century, Asante","This finial refers to the proverb, ""The hen knows well when it is dawn, but leaves it to the cock to announce."" This proverb may reference the decision-making power of the chief, represented by the rooster, as opposed to the wisdom of the elders, represented by the hen, and the role the linguist plays in mediating between the two. This staff, thus, is not only a royal insignia, but also a symbol of the shrewd and eloquent diplomat that the okyeame, or linguist, must be.",3812.0,"Culture

"Courtesan Walking, c. 1714, Kaigetsudo Anchi","Woodblock prints are regarded as the most characteristic expression of the Japanese artistic genius. Great quantities of this popular art form, called ukiyo-e (""pictures of the floating world""), were made during the Edo period (1603-1868) and sold inexpensively to a pleasure-seeking public captivated by Kabuki theater, sumo wrestling, and the brothel districts. Prints such as Kaigetsudo’s hand-painted Courtesan display a freedom and originality that were not possible in the rendering of tradition-bound religious images.

"The Cock Fight, 1885, Winslow Homer","In contrast to the free, confident brushwork of his Nassau images, Homer’s watercolors completed in Cuba (winter 1884-85) are characterized by more neutral color and finicky handling. In The Cock Fight, Homer used the simple backdrop of a plaster wall to offset his careful depiction of two decoratively feathered roosters. Although painted with atypical deliberation, the watercolor is intended to capture the fleeting moment when a battered young rooster has just vanquished an older, fully plumed male. As the fallen bird dies, feathers and dust stirred up by the battle still hover in the humid air.",3817.0,"Artist

"Standing Figurine, 800/400 B.C., Olmec","In the Gulf Coast lowlands of Veracruz and Tabasco between 900 and 400 B.C., Olmec rulers built cities with ceremonial earthen pyramids, platforms, and plazas. Monumental sculptures depict rulers and mythological themes, while small-scale figurines and related works commemorate important events. This figurine was found near the Coatzacoalcos River during the 1960s. It is carved in the style of figurines from a ritual offering at the major capital La Venta. These may have marked a rite of passage, when young men were initiated into office as rulers, warriors, priests, or traders in the stratified Olmec society.",3818.0,"Culture

"Earth, 1959, Morris Louis","Morris Louis lived and worked in and aroundWashington, D.C., where he was relatively isolated from developments in the New York art world. The goal of his art, in which color is both the vehicle and the content, was to realize the complete fusion of foreground and background, hue and texture. Louis’s saturated stripes and misty veils of color were achieved through a careful process of staining sheets of raw canvas, hung from vertical scaffolding, with thin washes of plastic-based paints. The artist allowed the paint to move over the canvas, guiding its flow with the curves of the loose canvas and a cloth-covered stick. Epic in size, Earth is part of the series Bronze Veils, paintings that Louis inverted after they were
completed so that the paint appears to flow from bottom to top.",3819.0,"Artist

"The Nativity, in Coffer, c. 1490, Master of the Unicorn Hunt","This woodcut and coffer demonstrate the very unusual survival of a print in its original context. Incredibly, ten other impressions of this stencil-colored, mass-produced Nativity survive, all also in boxes, and approximately one hundred other French coffers ornamented with similar prints exist. Their original purpose, however, remains uncertain. Despite their metal reinforcements and standardized lock, they were not sturdy enough to be strapped to pack animals. They may instead have been worn as backpacks, with the cushion on the bottom allowing the container to sit on the traveler’s knees for use as a movable shrine. A shallow secret compartment in the lid of this example is equally mysterious. It may have held contact relics, such as fabric or hair, or even consecrated Communion wafers, an unseen presence that would have reinforced the devotional value of the entire object.",3822.0,"Artist

"Toning the Bell, 1874, Walter Shirlaw","Like many artists of his generation, Walter Shirlaw furthered his training in Europe, studying at the Royal Academy in Munich. German instruction focused on a dark, painterly realism and was steeped in an astute understanding of aesthetic traditions. In Toning the Bell, executed during his student years and now considered his best-known work, the artist demonstrated an accomplished Munich style, featuring noble peasants, a limited tonal palette, and strong contrasts of light and dark. Prior to his time abroad, Shirlaw had worked in Chicago and helped establish the Chicago Academy of Design, a forerunner to the Art Institute of Chicago.",3829.0,"Artist

"The Day’s Orders (L’Ordre du Jour), May 1859, Camille Léon Louis Silvy","In this highly staged composition, which he nevertheless presented as a news photograph, Camille Silvy adapted a traditional genre painting for the depiction of a topical event. In May 1859, Emperor Napoleon III led the French Army into Italy to aid the controversial Italian unification movement (and secure the region of Nice for France). To rally French citizens behind his undertaking, the emperor sent his address to the frontline troops—the ""Day’s Orders""—instantly by electric telegraph back to Paris, where it was printed overnight and posted in the streets. Silvy staged an image of the populace gathering before a poster; two of the men, who turn to face the camera, represent the intellectual and revolutionary factions opposed to the virtual police state that characterized Paris under the emperor’s reign. The following week, the newspaper L’Illustration printed a lithographic reproduction of the photograph, making this picture one of the earliest examples of photojournalism.",3838.0,"Artist

"Living Sculpture, 1966, Marisa Merz","In the late 1960s the term Arte Povera was coined to describe the radical style of a group of Italian artists who began to engage everyday materials. Marisa Merz was included in the important Arte Povera + Azioni Povere exhibition in 1968 as one of the movement’s leading practitioners. She spent the majority of her career, however, retreating from the public sphere, creating works in intimate settings such as her home. Merz has in fact stated, “There has never been any division between my life and my work.” This three-part work belongs to the larger series Untitled (Living Sculptures), begun in 1965. These extraordinary objects, crafted from thin folds of pliant, layered sheet metal, were made to hang from the ceiling of her Turin apartment. Her living and working spaces became, to varying degrees, a forest, a hive, a cave, and a womb. Merz’s process turned simple industrial materials into fluid, organic forms. Removed from any social or narrative context, her abstract, formal inventions operate within their own temporal logic, reflecting the artist’s belief in the enduring effect of each artwork beyond its material realization and the constraints of time and place.",3840.0,"Artist
