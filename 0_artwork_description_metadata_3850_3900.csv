"Manicured Relief, 1930, Jean (Hans) Arp","A founding member of the Dada movement in Zurich, who was later involved with the Surrealists, Jean Arp questioned traditional notions of art. He experimented with spontaneous and seemingly irrational methods of artistic creation, embracing the notion of chance—a kind of depersonalization of the creative process that would influence subsequent generations of artists. Arp also challenged traditional artistic media, seeking to make abstract paper collages and machine-sawn wood reliefs that existed between the disciplines of painting and sculpture. Made of curvilinear, organic shapes, Arp’s reliefs explore a new, abstract ""biomorphic"" language that he shared with Joan Miró, André Masson, and other artists associated with Surrealism. Though Arp’s works are abstract, titles like Manicure-Relief often serve as witty interpretative codes suggesting an object’s counterpart in the physical world.",3854.0,"Artist

"The Miraculous Draught of Fishes, c. 1520, Ugo da Carpi","Chiaroscuro woodcut prints were developed to emulate the appearance of pen-and-ink drawings, which featured dark ink washes contrasted against white highlights. Here a middle tone of gray from a single block boldly colors the figures and their cast shadows, with the exposed tone of the paper used for the highlights. Additional black and green inks outline the figures and landscape. The sketched lines in orange completing the boats are later additions by an unknown hand. The print reproduces one of Raphael’s tapestry designs for the Sistine Chapel and was once owned by the collector Jean-Paul Mariette.",3855.0,"Artist

"Emperor Heraclius Slays the King of Persia, 1460/80","This panel was probably part of an altarpiece dedicated to the Holy Cross, a relic that was much venerated in the Middle Ages.

The emperor can be identified by the closed imperial crown that caps his helmet, the double-headed eagle symbol on the trumpet and the trappings of his followers’ horses, and the fact that he is about to behead his opponent. This exciting narrative provides an excuse for a vivid display of armor and weaponry.",3866.0,"Title

"Black Dots, 1941, Alexander Calder","Alexander Calder arrived in Paris in 1926 and soon forged an inventive new artistic path with caricature wire portraits and animals; he even produced a full circus environment in which he also performed. In the early 1930s, Calder began to make unconventional sculptures from flat pieces of steel, which he cut into biomorphic forms reminiscent of the work of his friends Joan Miró and Jean Arp. He bent, welded, and painted the steel pieces, assembling them into fixed (“stabile”) or moving (“mobile”) constructions, like Black Dots. These revolutionary works, presented without a traditional pedestal and often suspended from above, allowed Calder to explore the organic nature of artistic form as it continually shifted and evolved in the environment in which it was installed.",3868.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Fridrich Rorbach, 1532, Conrad Faber","This portrait would have served as a document of a marriage. Friedrich Rorbach’s name, age, and coat of arms, along with the date, are painted on the back of the panel, which was originally paired with a portrait of his wife, Katherina Knoblauchin, now in the National Gallery of Ireland. The two portraits share the same background— a fanciful mountain landscape. Conrad Faber, who worked in Frankfurt-am-Main, specialized in portraits depicting the patrician elite of that prosperous city. In the early 16th century, the energy and self-confidence of the many courts and free cities loosely united in the Holy Roman Empire brought about an artistic flowering in Germany.",3870.0,"Artist

"Nantasket Beach, 1876, Emil Carlsen","Trained in architecture in Copenhagen, Emil Carlsen emigrated in 1872 to Chicago, shifting his focus to painting. After further study in Paris, he relocated to Boston in 1876. Seaside tourism—a subject portrayed here by Carlsen and, more famously, by Winslow Homer—increased in popularity during the late 19th century. In Nantasket Beach Carlsen combined naturalism with a bright, light-filled palette, creating a plein-air seascape that harmonizes academic painting and Impressionism. Blue sky and white clouds fill much of the canvas. A woman with a parasol walks along the water’s edge, while two other figures rest in the sand and look out at the rolling waves and the ruins of a ship.",3878.0,"Artist

"Portrait Head of a Philosopher, Second half of the 2nd century AD, Ancient Roman","The Roman emperor Hadrian (r. A.D. 117–38), who embraced Greek intellectual pursuits, popularized the beard among men young and old, who had previously been clean-shaven. The beard quickly became a fashionable style as well as a sign of one’s interest in classical learning, leading elite Roman men to have themselves portrayed in the guise of philosophers. This portrait of an unidentified man, who wears a full beard and a hairstyle of wavy locks over his forehead, resembles portraits of the Greek philosopher Plato. The introspective eyes, with their heavy lids and drilled pupils, also contribute to the sitter’s intellectual demeanor.",3880.0,"Culture

For this monumental work, he designed three allegorical figures of France seated on an imperial eagle (a reference to the Emperor Napoleon III), flanked by semi-recumbent nude males representing science and agriculture. These plasters demonstrate Carpeaux’s initial conception as it was presented to the commissioning architect; they also reflect his close study of the sculpture of Michelangelo.",3889.0,"Artist

"Ugolino and His Sons Starving to Death in the Tower, 1806, Henry Fuseli","Count Ugolino della Gherardesca was a medieval Italian nobleman of Pisa accused of treason and locked in a tower with his sons and grandsons to starve to death. He was made famous as one of the damned souls in Dante’s poem the Inferno. Dante leaves unclear the ghoulish question of whether or not Ugolino ate his offspring’s corpses, which would have appealed to Fuseli’s dark imagination.
In a drawing of exquisite refinement and sensitivity, Fuseli uses his media (pen, wash, and graphite) to great effect, capturing the despair bordering on madness expressed by Ugolino’s stoic figure and demeanor.",3892.0,"Artist

"Secretary Cabinet, c. 1735, Giles Grendey","Giles Grendey was a cabinetmaker and timber merchant with workshops near St. Paul’s, London. Unusually for an English cabinetmaker of his time, he had a broad international clientele: a fire that struck his premises in August 1731 destroyed over £1000 worth of furniture (approximately $37,000 in today’s currency) described as “pack’d for Exportation against the next morning.” In fact, Grendey’s most famous commission came from a Spanish client, the Duke of Infantado, for whose castle at Lazcano in northern Spain he supplied a suite of over seventy-seven pieces of furniture in the late 1730s. This cabinet is decorated in a style similar to the Infantado suite, in red and gold japanning, the English name for imitation lacquer.",3899.0,"Artist
