"Christ Carrying the Cross, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",3909.0,"Artist

"Red No. 2, 1954, Sam Francis","Sam Francis’s early work was largely informed by the Abstract Expressionists’ lyricism and strong emphasis on color harmony. Living in Paris in the 1950s, the artist came under the influence of the Impressionist painters Claude Monet and Paul Cézanne, as well as their early 20th-century successors Pierre Bonnard and Henri Matisse. After viewing Monet’s Nympheas at L’Orangerie in 1953, Francis transformed his palette from pale grays and muted hues to an explosive mixture of primary colors. With its juxtaposition of cadmium red and deep blue, a combination that makes the surface seem to pulsate, Red No. 2 exemplifies the vibrancy of Francis’s paintings from this era.",3918.0,"Artist

"The Grand Arab (He Only Has Sand), 1947, Jean Dubuffet","Dismayed by the state of society after the brutalities of World War II, Jean Dubuffet looked to nontraditional artistic sources, especially those of non-Western cultures. Beginning in 1947, Dubuffet took three extended trips to the Sahara; based on the art and culture he experienced on these visits, he made a number of works, including The Grand Arab. In 1951 he developed a personal manifesto critiquing the conformity of Western society and delivered his “Anticultural Positions” in a lecture at the Arts Club of Chicago. He urged for a postwar renaissance: “The values celebrated by our culture do not … correspond to the true dynamics of our minds.” His presentation inspired many young artists and collectors in Chicago, who were eager to find new artistic forms that were distinct from the iconic European modernist tradition.",3923.0,"Artist

"The Last Judgment from Les Sept Articles de la Foi by Jean Chappuis, c. 1470, Egregius Pictor Franciscus","In this powerful image, Christ elevates the chosen, assisted by angels, while demons drag the damned toward hell. Jean Chapuis’s 14th-century poem The Seven Articles of Faith explores the moral implications of Christ’s birth, baptism, death, descent into hell, resurrection, ascension, and second coming. Treated like a small panel painting rather than a decorated page, this image is characteristic of an accomplished illuminator called the Maitre François in its carefully rendered expressions and delicate use of minute stippling.",3926.0,"Artist

"Piano Americano, 1996, Vanessa Beecroft","Vanessa Beecroft stages tableaux vivants of nude or seminude women, whom she arranges in loose configurations according to predetermined rules. Her works center on these public performances but often culminate in photographs or videos. Beecroft blurs the boundary between art and fashion to the point that, in recent years, eminent designers have provided the attire for her models. Adopting the fashion industry’s use of sex as a sales tool and openly presenting women as a silent visual spectacle, she engages with structures of power and economies of desire while provocatively toying with cultural expectations of female sexuality.
In Piano Americano, two women in beige trench coats sit decorously in chairs, facing the camera, while to their left a woman in a bright green party dress sprawls on the floor. Behind them, nine women in flesh-colored underwear mill around, looking aloof or bored, occasionally squatting down or running their hands along the wall. Over the course of half an hour, the camera slowly pans across the different groupings of women. Eventually it begins to zoom in on their faces and their bodies, both enacting and eliciting the viewer’s lingering gaze. Beecroft’s work partakes in the voyeuristic dynamics of sexual consumerism with a degree of self-conscious complicity, but she also denaturalizes these patterns and invites the viewer’s discomfort. Beecroft has said, “I like to display nudity to provoke the fear or embarrassment or the confusion of the audience.” Poised between eroticism and cool, structured formalism, her living displays are suggestive but emotionally vacant, demonstrating an aloof yet potentially aggressive sexuality.",3928.0,"Artist

"Female Shinto Deity, 12th century","In Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan, female deities play an equally important role as their male counterparts. The earliest surviving sculptures of female Shinto deities date to the ninth century, and they often form a set with a depiction of the male deity Hachiman. In contrast to those of their companion, however, the goddesses’ identities are inexact, and such sculptures show a generic woman of the imperial court in secular dress.",3936.0,"Title

"Lantern, c. 1922, Arthur Dove","Although Arthur Dove’s work as a whole is marked by his fascination with natural elements, he occasionally explored industrial or manmade motifs, including the lighting device that dominates Lantern. Like his colleague Stuart Davis, whose painting Saw (1988.144) transforms a mundane item into an artistic still life, Dove depicts the prosaic lantern as the object of aesthetic contemplation. Despite its abstracted forms, components of the lantern (probably a Coleman arc lantern) are recognizable, among them the two glowing mantles, the perforated collar with its black fuel valve, and the pump plunger. He employed a shimmering silver paint to depict the lantern’s globe as a flat, circular form, further marking his willingness to explore unusual materials.",3939.0,"Artist
