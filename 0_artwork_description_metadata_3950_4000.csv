"Untitled (For Trista), c. 1969, Joseph Cornell","This box may have been the last one Cornell ever made. He dedicated it to Trista Stern (born 1960), eldest daughter of the ballerina Allegra Kent and the photographer Bert Stern. Cornell met Kent in 1956, and they were particularly close in 1969. As Kent recalled, “My greatest rapport with Joseph came on a visit August 13, 1969. I was very depressed … I went out to see Joseph and we lost ourselves talking about music, nature and shells” (Allegra Kent, “Joseph Cornell: A Reminiscence,” in New York, Castelli, Feigen, Corcoran, Joseph Cornell Portfolio, 1976, exh. cat., n. pag.).",3951.0,"Artist

"Untitled (For Trista), c. 1969, Joseph Cornell","Like so many of Cornell‘s boxes, this is a game, which can only be fully revealed when it is manipulated. The map is a comparative chart of the world’s rivers, as its title informs us. It is, in other words, an imaginary map, and the blank area at its heart, resembling a map of the Arctic or Antarctic, is a purely notional “source” point. At its center is an orienting compass, the only part of the map visible when the back panel is closed. Although topographical charts appear relatively infrequently in Cornell’s work, compared with maps of the heavens ancient or modern, the ingenious character of this one must have appealed to him.",3951.0,"Artist

"Untitled (For Trista), c. 1969, Joseph Cornell","Three objects move freely on top of the plywood panel: a metal globe, a hollow blue plastic cube, and a red wooden bead. Each can be caught in the hole in the panel by tilting the box, which may well have been conceived to work horizontally, as well as vertically, based on the orientation of the inscriptions on the back (see a href=""http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/99765"">Untitled (Black Hunter). Rather than the navigation boxes, to which it has a superficial resemblance, this box strongly recalls the educational, “philosophical” toy so popular with the Victorians: a lesson about the world and its dimensions.",3951.0,"Artist

"Loose Beauty, 1973, Christina Ramberg","Christina Ramberg’s paintings frequently present the female figure in pieces—a torso, a foot, the back of a head. The visual impact of her fetishistic fragmentation of the body is heightened through a meticulous attention to the painted surface; this “finish-fetishism” is a common formal feature of the work of the Chicago Imagists, with whom Ramberg was affiliated in the late 1960s. A persistent concern throughout her work is the ambivalent relationship between the female body and the material that adorns it. In Loose Beauty, the textural interplay between the figure’s smooth flesh and alternately slick and scalloped undergarments calls attention to a duality of pleasurable sensuality and disciplining constraint.",3957.0,"Artist

"Christ Presented to the People, 1475/85, Northern Netherlandish School","This is a rare example of a surviving 15th-century painting from the northern provinces of the Netherlands (present-day Holland). This region had fewer centers of artistic production than the more populous southern Netherlands, and it also experienced substantial destruction of artworks during the iconoclastic outbursts of the mid-16th century. The few surviving panel paintings, as well as illuminated manuscripts, from this region are often characterized by an earthy realism. Here the artist was equally interested in the hostile reactions of the crowd as he was in giving poignancy to the figure of Christ, whom the Roman governor Pontius Pilate presents to the people for judgment.",3963.0,"Artist

"Truth, 1900, Daniel Chester French","In 1898 Daniel Chester French was commissioned to create six allegorical figures representing Bounty, Courage, Integrity, Prudence, Truth, and Wisdom, for the facade of the Minnesota State Capitol Building, in Saint Paul. This plaster statue is a working model and is half the size of the marble figure that appears, paired with Integrity. In his portrayal of Truth, French used symbols drawn from classical and Renaissance sources. The mirror she holds reflects life without illusions; her partial nudity alludes to the nature of truth.",3967.0,"Artist

"The Old Dragoons of 1850, Modeled 1905, cast 1906/7, Frederic Remington","The Old Dragoons of 1850 is another feat of Frederic Remington’s technical achievement. Stretching, twisting men and horses move at top speed, depicted by Remington in an arrested moment in time. The complex sculpture suggests the chaos of eyewitness observation, yet it also achieves the choreographed monumentality and unity of synthetic composition. Remington designed his three-dimensional works after the drawings and photographs he made on his trips to the West, and the ability to freeze motion photographically undoubtedly fed the force and dynamism of his sculpture.",3974.0,"Artists

"Blue Phoenix, 1921, Omura Koyo","Omura Koyo’s Blue Phoenix overwhelms the viewer with a close-up scene of a lush tropical forest inhabited by exotic birds known as the Great Argus. On the right, a pair of birds perch calmly. By contrast, on the left, the active male bird fans out its patterned feathers across the panels in a mating dance. Overall, the work displays the bright red and orange blossoms of the Royal Poinciana flower. The subject matter comes from sketches the artist made during a trip to the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia). The dynamic composition fills each corner of the oversized screens, and the green and red colors of the foliage are set off by the silk backed with gold foil, casting a subtle glow over the entire scene.",3999.0,"Artist
