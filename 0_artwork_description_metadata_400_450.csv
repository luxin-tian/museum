"Delphine, 1999, Diana Thater","Widely recognized as a pioneer of video art as installation, California-based artist Diana Thater is best known for work featuring images of animals such as bees, horses, and wolves. In Delphine, which takes as its primary subject wild dolphins interacting with humans, the artist worked for the very first time with untrained animals in their natural habitat. Complex spatial thinking is key to Thater’s projects; she understands installation art as a dialogue between sculpture and architecture. Projected on a large scale—onto entire ceilings, walls, and floors—her work thoroughly transforms the physical realities of the spaces it inhabits. This generic and spatial fluidity blurs conventional boundaries between the work and the viewer. The artist also insists on revealing how her images are made. Shot in both digital video and film, Delphine was edited without regard for separating the different media. Clarity and grain flow together as the immediacy and flatness of video gives way to the depth of film. These self-conscious production methods are mirrored by Thater’s particular aesthetic of presentation: she always leaves her equipment in full view inside the installation. This transparent approach, the artist insisted, “does not, as some people might have us believe, preclude transcendence. This is ultimately my point—that neither magic nor superficial beauty is required to approach the sublime.”",400.0,"Artist

"Royal Horse Inspection, Safavid dynasty (1501–1722), late 17th century, ‘Aliquli Jabbadar","The setting for the painting is the royal stables in Isfahan. The upper portion of the scene consists of a platform on which are gathered the shah, or Persian king, who appears next to the column on the right; five kneeling courtiers; and various attendants serving fruit and wine. The king is identified in the artist’s signature at the upper left as Shah ‘Abbas II, who died in 1666, but it is possible that the undated painting was executed after his death. The ruler’s status is emphasized by his golden halo and by the opulent gold and jeweled vessels placed before him. The lower portion shows a roundup of horses who bear the trident-like royal brand on their flanks; they move in a spiral that coils counterclockwise from the upper right. The scene bursts with energy and looks chaotic—a brawl is taking place at the lower left—but the courtiers and handlers seem to be getting control of the animals. The figures on the platform, meanwhile, pay no attention to the commotion below.",401.0,"Artist

"Royal Horse Inspection, Safavid dynasty (1501–1722), late 17th century, ‘Aliquli Jabbadar","The painting represents a new journalistic, even anecdotal approach to Persian painting introduced in the second half of the seventeenth century. The viewer gets the sense that the work may record a specific moment in daily life at court and that it was observed firsthand. Figures no longer conform to stock types but are highly individualized by facial features and dress. Standing just to the right of center in the upper part of the roundup scene is a man wearing a gold, fur-lined, armless jacket. He holds a list and is writing notes while conferring with a young man in a blue robe. The man taking notes may well be the supervisor of the royal stud, one of whose responsibilities was to inspect the king’s stables and keep an inventory of the animals.",401.0,"Artist

"Fête du Trône, 1925, Jean-Eugène-Auguste Atget","For almost three decades, Eugène Atget, an actor turned documentary photographer, organized views of Paris into an elaborately ordered archive that mapped the city in its details and registered a broad complaint against its transformation from a world of artisans and individuals into a capital of spectacle. Usually early in the morning, Atget hauled a large view camera, a wood tripod, and heavy glass plates around the city to do his work. In Fête du trône, the photographer captured a curious window display featuring articles associated with a giant and a midget, a sort of ready-made Surrealism. In 1925, the year this photograph was taken, Atget was discovered by the expatriate American artist and photographer Man Ray, who was part of the Surrealist circle of poets and artists in Paris. With Man Ray’s support, Atget’s work began to be published and recognized as more than just a visual history of Paris. Upon Atget’s death, Man Ray’s assistant, the photographer Berenice Abbott, acquired the more than eight thousand prints found in his studio and devoted decades to promoting his vast and remarkable oeuvre. The funds for Abbott’s purchase were supplied by Julien Levy, a prominent dealer of photography and Surrealism, the core of whose photographic collection is held at the Art Institute.",402.0,"Artist

"Urns (Set of 8), 1999, Thomas Schütte","Avoiding any signature style, Thomas Schütte has produced an oeuvre of perplexing diversity, including architectural models, photographs, sculpture, and watercolor drawings. His decidedly unimposing, antiheroic works explore the cultural, economic, historical, and social conditions of his native Germany with a detached, often humorous, sensibility. Much of Schütte’s work addresses the almost existential difficulty postwar German artists encounter in attempting to create monuments and memorials. As such, it evidences an ongoing preoccupation with themes of death, mourning, and collective memory. This is true of Urns, an installation comprising eight ceramic vessels glazed in a palette of solid colors marked by streaks, drips, and other surface effects. Ranging from three to five feet in height, these fragile containers at once imply living bodies and oversize repositories for their ashes. The vessels are intended to be grouped together, like a family. Displayed closed, these mysterious containers prompt speculation about what might be contained inside. One of the urns, however, lacks a top and bottom; viewing the installation from above reveals that it is empty.",403.0,"Artist

"Bureau Table, c. 1770, John Townsend","This elegant piece epitomizes the Late Baroque style that flourished in Newport, Rhode Island. It is one of six bureaus that can be attributed to the celebrated cabinetmaker John Townsend on the basis of similar construction and design features in labeled pieces by the maker. For example, the carved shells have central C-scrolls featuring petals and crosshatched baskets, all motifs that are indicative of Townsend’s work. In addition, the top is integrated into the case by cove-and-bead molding, with smaller cavetto molding underneath.

They were particularly popular among the Quaker citizens of Newport, who appreciated the wide array of storage possibilities they offered. According to oral tradition, Samuel Fowler originally owned this bureau. A successful merchant, Fowler frequently conducted business with the Townsend family. In 1786 and 1787, John Townsend purchased hinges, nails, and sundries from Fowler. This relationship bolsters the argument that Fowler owned this bureau, since patronage loyalty resulting from familial, religious, and trading ties was typical in eighteenth-century Newport.",404.0,"Artist

Once belonging to a set of two, this splendid piece of Brussels lace may have been made for the Sun King himself shortly before his death. This type of bobbin part-lace, initially produced in Brussels during the eighteenth century, consists of individual motifs made separately but joined together so skillfully that the seams are almost imperceptible. Worn with its mate, slightly gathered at the neck, this rectangular piece of fabric is replete with symbols signifying the elevated status of its wearer. At center are a rooster and trophies, beneath which is the king’s monogram of double Ls. Surmounting this image and supported by two trumpeting angels is a baldachin, a canopy carried over important personages during processions.

"Gingold Living Room End Table (1 of 2), c. 1943, Rudolph Michael Schindler","An early pioneer of modern architecture and interior design in southern California, Rudolf M. Schindler presented a new, austere aesthetic that became synonymous with the region’s progressive culture. Made of veneered plywood, many of his innovative furniture designs can be seen as a microcosm of his larger architectural vision. These living-room end tables, with their crisp, geometric compositions, are iconic examples of Schindler’s avant-garde ideology and meticulous craftsmanship. Born in Vienna, Schindler received his formal training in art and engineering at the city’s Academy of Fine Arts. Influenced by the work of Adolf Loos and Frank Lloyd Wright, Schindler came to Chicago in 1914, and four years later Wright hired him to work on a variety of projects, including the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo (1915–22) and the Hollyhock House in Los Angeles (1917–20). In 1922 Schindler left Wright’s firm to establish his own practice in Los Angeles, where his commissions were mostly residential buildings. His iconic King’s Road Home (1922) and the Lovell Beach House (1926) set the tone for the experimentation with common building materials that is now typical of many Los Angeles–based practitioners such as Frank O. Gehry and Morphosis, who are reshaping the formal characteristics of architecture.",409.0,"Artist

He has discussed this particular painting with reference to power and art, remarking, “The big blue painting that I painted in 1984—the one I love so much! … I borrowed that [concept of power] from the Chinese traditional mentality. There is this Chinese saying, ‘power is formless.’ That’s my language too.” Formless power is an apt description of the whole of Zhang’s practice; from his first painting, his art has always been subversive. He worked always outside of China’s official arts institutions, first as part of the No Name Art Group and later when he used his apartment as a makeshift salon and art gallery.

"Dymaxion Car, Section, 1933, Richard Buckminster Fuller","Trained in engineering, Buckminster Fuller made significant contributions to disciplines including architecture, industrial design, philosophy, and social science. Central to all his endeavors was a holistic understanding of the universe and a desire to use science and technology in a sustainable manner to better serve mankind and the planet. Fuller coined the term dymaxion to label his inventions that applied available technology to provide the greatest possible efficiency. In 1927 he began investigating designs that would revolutionize transportation. Fuller used existing automotive parts and boat and airplane technology to design the Dymaxion Car, which debuted to an awed public at the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. The aerodynamic bullet shape and lightweight aluminum chassis enabled the car to reach speeds of 120 miles per hour, and consumed thirty miles per gallon. The three-wheeled vehicle had exceptional maneuverability due to its rear-wheel drivetrain. Fuller refined the design in the 1940s, but a prototype proved prohibitively expensive to manufacture. Although considered too radical to mass-produce at the time, Fuller’s Dymaxion Car presaged many features considered standard in today’s automobiles.",412.0,"Artist

"Pair of Cups, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Yongzheng reign mark and period (1723–1735)","The emperors of China’s last dynasty, the Qing, were enamored of exquisitely decorative objects and recruited remarkable craftsmen to serve their court. During his brief reign, the Yongzheng emperor, himself an artist and astute connoisseur, took a personal role in overseeing the imperial kilns. In their elegance and technical sophistication, these extraordinarily thin cups exemplify his exacting standards. Their floral medallions were delicately outlined in pale cobalt blue and, after glazing and firing, filled with soft, translucent enamels. So perfectly do these enamels fill the outlines that this technique is known as doucai (joined or dovetailed colors). Although quite different from the naturalistic floral motifs that characterize many Qing imperial porcelains, these medallions are also seen in rare examples of exquisite Yongzheng ware in the Palace Museum in Beijing. Their style may reflect the influence of Japanese lacquers, which were imported into China in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and subsequently inspired creative copies by Chinese palace craftsmen. The Yongzheng emperor was renowned for having encouraged innovative and sometimes foreign-inspired design in ceramics as well as other decorative arts.",413.0,"Title

"Male-Female Figure with Pomegranate, 1968, Ibrahim El-Salahi","Ibrahim El-Salahi swiftly became one of the most influential artists working in Sudan after the country gained independence in 1956. His paintings combine African motifs, Islamic calligraphy, and Euro-American modernism. A member of the revolutionary Khartoum school, El-Salahi contributed to the intellectual climate of postcolonial Sudan and the making of a national art and aesthetic in the 1960s. His work is characterized by the use of earthy colors, the transformation of Arabic letters into abstracted forms, and the merging of folk art with modern abstract painting. The artist once described the “Pandora’s box” of animal, plant, and, more specifically, skeletal and masked forms that seemed to open for him as he deconstructed and abstracted the shapes of written language; he was also inspired by the structure of West African masks.",415.0,"Artist

"Male-Female Figure with Pomegranate, 1968, Ibrahim El-Salahi","A radically abstracted figure—holding a pomegranate in its right hand—plays a prominent role in Male-Female Figure and the Pomegranate. Just as striking, however, is the material surface of the work, with its array of intricate textures. This painting exemplifies the artist’s innovations of the 1960s both in its compositional complexity and its evident engagement with process. El-Salahi used enamel and oil paint as well as a technique he called “tickling,” which involved manipulating the canvas with his fingers to create the appearance of depth. Discussing this painting, he has said, “I did it in Sudan, at a time when I was focusing on … somber relations. I started by building the image with a mixture of white oil and enamel paints, then treated it with a glaze of burnt sienna and black oil paints mixed with linseed oil. I used an old canvas, which after some time I had rolled so that the paint would crack, because that was the effect I wanted.”",415.0,"Artist

Remarkable for its large size and luxurious decoration, the service was designed for Count Heinrich von Brühl, who was both administrator of the Royal Saxon Porcelain Manufactory at Meissen and prime minister to Augustus III (r. 1733–63), elector of Saxony and king of Poland. The centerpiece consists of a large, flat plateau made in sections fitted together to support a tall, four-legged, open basket decorated with fanciful roosters and Chinese figures. At either end of the plateau are sugar casters in the form of Chinese figures embracing under a canopy. Established in 1710, the Meissen factory dominated porcelain production in Europe until the mid-eighteenth century and continues to operate to this day.",416.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1965, Saitō Yoshishige","A leader of Japanese abstraction throughout his life, Saitō Yoshishige influenced a generation of artists in his home country, particularly those who later defined the Mona-ha movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which prioritized simple, minimally manipulated natural and industrial materials. Although trained as a painter, as early as the 1930s Saitō began a series of controversial plywood reliefs that were difficult to classify as either painting or sculpture, as those conventional categories were understood at the time. Much of his work was then lost or destroyed during World War II, but Saitō gradually made his way back to the wall-relief format, producing his best-known and intensely physical works—the painted, gouged, and drilled wood panels of the 1960s.",417.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1965, Saitō Yoshishige","“The ideal is a painting surface that can stand up to the real, concrete colors that have quality and strength,” Saitō once said, insisting that paintings themselves must be understood to—or must be made to—“solidly exist.” In 1960 he first used a power drill to scar the surface of his works; the small circular depressions in this relief were produced by the carefully controlled pressure of such a drill, at once an act of aggression against the previously flat surface of the panel and also a gesture of decoration or elaboration. In this complex composition, the irregular grid of drilled depressions is counterbalanced by the sleek white curved elements collaged around them. Meanwhile the vibrant, almost velvety blue paint appeals as much to a viewer’s sense of touch as to her eye.",417.0,"Artist

"Gingold Living Room End Table (2 of 2), c. 1943, Rudolph Michael Schindler","An early pioneer of modern architecture and interior design in southern California, Rudolf M. Schindler presented a new, austere aesthetic that became synonymous with the region’s progressive culture. Made of veneered plywood, many of his innovative furniture designs can be seen as a microcosm of his larger architectural vision. These living-room end tables, with their crisp, geometric compositions, are iconic examples of Schindler’s avant-garde ideology and meticulous craftsmanship. Born in Vienna, Schindler received his formal training in art and engineering at the city’s Academy of Fine Arts. Influenced by the work of Adolf Loos and Frank Lloyd Wright, Schindler came to Chicago in 1914, and four years later Wright hired him to work on a variety of projects, including the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo (1915–22) and the Hollyhock House in Los Angeles (1917–20). In 1922 Schindler left Wright’s firm to establish his own practice in Los Angeles, where his commissions were mostly residential buildings. His iconic King’s Road Home (1922) and the Lovell Beach House (1926) set the tone for the experimentation with common building materials that is now typical of many Los Angeles–based practitioners such as Frank O. Gehry and Morphosis, who are reshaping the formal characteristics of architecture.",418.0,"Artist

"Untitled 72–12–A, 1972, Chung, Sang-Hwa","Chung Sang-Hwa’s signature technique entails a repetitive process of applying and then removing paint, so that each work comprises both positive and negative space, with raw canvas as much a part of its structure as the paint itself. Considered representative of the Korean Tansaekhwa (monochrome painting) movement in the 1970s and 1980s, Chung’s works are thus defined not by any single choice of color but instead by how they were made. Indeed, many products of the movement were referred to as pangbop—“methods” — rather than as paintings; the centrality of method or process led Korean art critic Yi Kyung-Sung to describe Tansaekhwa works in terms of drawing with, spreading, bleeding, spilling, and pushing paint, for instance.",419.0,"Artist

"Untitled 72–12–A, 1972, Chung, Sang-Hwa","Untitled, 72-12-A is one of Chung’s key transitional works, among the first in which he initially employed uniform, allover applications of paint before then peeling and scraping some of it away. The resulting canvas was then covered from edge to edge by two different kinds of marks: those that remain from the first white coats and the similarly sized “strokes” made by pulling paint away. These latter gestures sometimes expose the loosely woven brown canvas support and at other times reveal underlayers of different white paints—some matte, some shiny, some off-white, and some faintly yellow. The large scale of this simultaneously random and exacting composition raises issues of labor, intensity, and intention. At the same time, the very idea of a composition is thrown into question: Chung filled his canvas evenly and without emphasis, often shifting it as he worked in order to ensure a kind of noncompositional unity across the entire field of the painting.",419.0,"Artist

"I’timad-ud-Daula’s Tomb at Agra, c. 1820","This architectural rendering of a magnificent tomb at Agra provides an accurate depiction of the pietra dura inlays and carved marble jali screens of the mausoleum built by the Mughal empress Nur Jahan in honor of her father, Mirza Ghiyas Beg, who rose to become the prime minister under the emperor Jahangir (r. 1605–27) and held the exalted title I’timad-ud-Daula (Pillar of the Empire). The powerful Nur Jahan had immense financial resources at her disposal. Built between 1622 and 1628 and modest in size, as befitted the mausoleum of a nobleman rather than an emperor, the structure is lavish in its use of semiprecious stones, and the workmanship and design are of unsurpassed quality. In its exclusive use of white marble, it antedates the Taj Mahal and is considered by many to be the finer monument.",420.0,"Title

"I’timad-ud-Daula’s Tomb at Agra, c. 1820","This drawing was created in the Company style, named after the British East India Company, which spearheaded English mercantile and political interests in the subcontinent from the early seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth century. The British were eager to record and catalogue everything they saw. In the absence of photography, first British and later Indian artists, who excelled in drawing and painting fine details, recorded the sights. The style arose in the later part of the eighteenth century and ended in the mid-nineteenth with the beginning of photography. In addition to architectural drawings, other subjects included animal and botanical studies, occupations and trades, regional dress, festivals, and scenes of village life.",420.0,"Title

"Wall Drawing #821: A black square divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts, each with a different direction of alternating flat and glossy bands, 1997, Sol LeWitt","Over nearly four decades, Sol LeWitt’s work—equal parts conceptual and visual—introduced new ways of making and thinking about art. The artist posited his influential ideas most clearly in over 1,200 wall drawings, which he conceived between 1968 and his death in 2007. LeWitt shared the creation of his work with other makers—trained draftsman and, in most cases, assistants hired from local art schools or institutions—extending the collaborative possibilities of his artwork indefinitely. Through the 1980s, the artist used only traditional drawing media such as crayon, ink, and pencil. In the following decade, however, acrylic paint became his dominant medium. Wall Drawing #821 depicts a signature motif with monumental solemnity. The work comprises a grid of horizontal, vertical, and opposing diagonal lines, which were LeWitt’s most fundamental geometric and linear building blocks. The artist usually rendered this motif graphically; in this work, however, the figure-ground relationship is articulated solely through the juxtaposition of subtly differentiated matte and gloss paints.",421.0,"Artist

"Shaffron, c. 1575","Chivalry—with its connotation of the knightly ideal—was intimately connected with the horse (cheval in French). A knight took care to protect his mount, on which he was dependent for the mobility and speed required in both attack and retreat. In Roman times, some heavy cavalry used armor made of iron or bronze scales to protect their horses. From the twelth century on, knights covered their steeds in bands of iron mail (a network of interlocking rings). By the fifteenth century, full-plate armors were not uncommon. This shaffron, or headpiece, is etched in gilt bands with decoration on a finely dotted ground. Riveted between the eyes is an elongated conical spike, perhaps inspired by the horn of the mythical unicorn. A manifestation of great power and wealth, the shaffron has been valued for centuries as an object of beauty, not just as a tool of warfare and sport.",422.0,"Title

"Lion (One of a Pair, South Pedestal), 1893, Edward Kemeys","Iconic guardians of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Lions have stood at the Michigan Avenue entrance since the building’s inaugural year. The site became the museum’s permanent home at the conclusion of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, where the new structure had hosted lectures and other events for fairgoers. Modeled by Edward Kemeys, an essentially self-taught artist and the nation’s first great animalier (sculptor of animals), the lion pair was unveiled on May 10, 1894. Kemeys focused his talents on sculptural portrayals of North American wildlife, capturing such native creatures in anatomical, naturalistic detail. For the Art Institute, he modeled larger-than-life African lions, the one positioned north of the steps “on the prowl” and the lion to the south “in an attitude of defiance,” in Kemeys’s words. These behavioral distinctions are visible in the variation of head, tail, and stance. Each weighing in at more than two tons, the Lions were cast in Chicago by the American Bronze Founding Company.",428.0,"Artist

He can be seen at the top in the clouds. Salvator Rosa executed this colossal composition at the pinnacle of his etching career, and dedicated it to the Florentine poet Horatio Quaranta. Rosa’s pessimistic admonition appears at the bottom of the sheet: “They are raised up high that they may be hurled down in more terrible ruin.”
Multitalented with boundless energy, Rosa was also a poet, actor, musician, and painter. He made this print to promote his ideas for a painting of the same subject in hopes that a patron would sponsor its execution.",429.0,"Artist
