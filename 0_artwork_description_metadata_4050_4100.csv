"Untitled (Sun Box), c. 1955, Joseph Cornell","Although spare in appearance, this box brings together several familiar themes in Cornell‘s work: birds (associated with the ring), travel, cosmology, and popular imagery. The startling, grotesquely grinning paper sun suggests children’s entertainment, perhaps even a cardboard theater. The contrast between this yellow sun and the white cork balls, which by association become moons, is echoed in the white and yellow dots of paint, meticulously formed into circles, for all their apparently random splattering. The formal and the metaphorical are beautifully balanced here, as so often in Cornell’s work.",4054.0,"Artist

"Adam and Eve, 1543, Hans Sebald Beham","For disobeying God’s orders and eating the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, Adam and Eve received the punishment of mortality, hard work, and pain. A skeleton, an obvious symbol of death, forms the trunk of the fatal tree, and the evil serpent winds its way through the skeleton’s hollow torso. Sebald Beham’s sensuous intertwining of the nudes, snake, and skeleton blatantly marks this depiction as a sexual awakening. While Adam is entirely naked, the gesture of Eve’s free hand both covers and accentuates her newfound sexuality.",4061.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Philippe Coypel and His Wife, 1742, Charles-Antoine Coypel","Charles-Antoine Coypel served as First Painter to the King and was also a professor at, and eventually Director of, the French Academy. Part of a powerful artistic dynasty, he was a significant collector, an aesthetic theorist, playwright, and poet, and an amateur actor. Although many of his most important paintings have been lost, this unusual double portrait pastel probably commemorates the tenth anniversary of the artist’s beloved brother, Philippe Coypel ( 1703-1777) and his wife Marie-Catherine Botet.

"From My Window at An American Place, North, 1930/31, Alfred Stieglitz","“My first memory of Alfred Stieglitz,” recalled the photographer’s wife, the painter Georgia O’Keeffe, “was on a day in 1908 when … I went with two or three other students to see the Rodin drawings at ‘291.’ … where a new kind of art was shown—and it was the only place in New York you could see anything like it.” O’Keeffe’s reminiscence suggests the influential character of the work Stieglitz promoted, and of his gallery itself. The photographer operated galleries throughout his life, using them as a platform to present his vision of modern art in America; he also treated his last gallery, An American Place, as a site for artistic creativity in its own right. The Art Institute was one of several major museums to receive gifts from Stieglitz’s collection—via O’Keeffe, his executor—in 1949; these donations often marked (as here) the institutions’ first acquisition of photographs as art.

The doors, pillars, and lintel assembled here reconstruct the entrance to such a chamber. Before firing, the bricks were stamped with vigorous images from daily life and from mythology. This combination of subject matters reflects a dualistic view of the human soul: separating at death, one part of the soul was thought to remain in the earthly tomb, while the other ascended to a paradise—the realm of ancestral spirits and of the special beings who have achieved immortality.",4071.0,"Title

"Nude Woman Standing, Drying Herself, 1891–92, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","Images of women washing themselves are ubiquitous in the history of Western art. The female nude in general has long been considered one of the most important subjects of artistic expression, most importantly in the form of history painting, traditionally represented in classical or biblical subjects. However, in the late 19th century progressive artists spurned traditional history painting in favor of contemporary subject matter—art of the moment that represented real life. The artists featured in this gallery made the theme of the bathing woman thoroughly modern. During this period, public health officials encouraged regular bathing not only for cosmetic reasons, but also as a means to combat diseases such as cholera. As a result, more and more people washed indoors regularly. The images in this gallery by Edgar Degas, Félix Vallotton, Pierre Bonnard, and Suzanne Valadon, for example, show modern accouterments of indoor plumbing—large porcelain tubs and taps for running water. Though these prints and drawings allude to contemporary industrial developments and evolving societal expectations, they remain principally devoid of narrative. They depict anonymous women across a range of social classes, including some models who were probably prostitutes, in the intimate act of washing. These artists used the subject of the bathing woman as an evocative means to an end—especially Degas, who returned to the theme of the bather literally hundreds of times between the late 1870s and his death in 1917. Degas utilized bathers to explore the possibilities of the human form—employing multiple angles and viewpoints, depicting its shape and various movements, and reflecting the many colors and textures of the environment.",4075.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Game), c. 1940, Joseph Cornell","The notion of the “Surrealist toy” may be understood as one of Cornell‘s responses to the complex and elastic idea of the Surrealist object. A toy or game normally involves movement in the object and the active participation of the player (s). In addition to the early puzzle boxes and the optical and kinetic games with which Cornell tinkered, there are two Surrealist sources for the game boxes. One is the Surrealist object as conceived by Salvador Dalí in 1931 (see Salvador Dalí, “Objects surrealistes,”Le Surrealisme au service de La revolution 3 [Dec. 1931]); the other is found in Marcel Duchamp’s work. The immediate inspiration for Dali’s type of object was Alberto Giacometti’s Suspended Ball (1930–31; Yves Bonnefoy, Alberto Giacomelli: A Biography of His Work, Paris, 1991, pl. 176), the difference between this and the Surrealist object with symbolic function being that the latter was to be constructed of ready-made, found materials, rather than traditional sculptural ones. Cornell was certainly aware of Giacometti’s Suspended Ball by the time he made his construction Ball and Book in 1934 (Art of this Century, New York 1942, exh. cat., p. 149; and New York, 1980–82, no. 63, ill.), but unlike Giacometti he significantly refrained in his construction from any erotic over tones. He seems to have felt more kinship with the readymades and “readymades aides” (assisted readymades) of Duchamp. Duchamp was the first person literally to introduce movement into his work in his Bicycle Wheel of 1913 (original lost; Pontus Hulten, ed., Marcel Duchamp: Work and Life, Cambridge, Mass., 1993, p. 30, ill.), but more relevant to Cornell’s work are Duchamp’s With Hidden Noise (1916)—the first object to incorporate noise as an element—and Why Not Sneeze Rrose Selavy (1921, both in the Philadelphia Museum of Art; Hulten 1993, pp. 63, 79, ills.). The secretive character of the former would certainly have appealed to him. Duchamp’s With Hidden Noise, enigmatic as it is, looks however like a machine part forgotten on a factory floor, its invisible, rattling innards the result of a random oversight; Cornell’s game boxes resemble in stead toys long relegated to the attic, the noise generated by rolling ball rattling counter clearly part of their original function as games, whose rules or objectives have long since been forgotten.",4076.0,"Artist

"Nathan Hale, Modeled 1890, cast after 1890, Frederick William MacMonnies","Frederick William MacMonnies was one of the most important American sculptors of the late 19th century. Nathan Hale represents MacMonnies’s first public commission won by competition, and the sculpture’s installation in City Hall Park in New York brought him immediate fame. MacMonnies spent much of his professional life in France, where he earned and executed this commission. The figure’s modeling is remarkably expressive—even in this version of reduced scale—MacMonnies harmonizing a measure of romanticism with the period’s growing taste for naturalism in bronze. A Revolutionary War–era hero hanged by the British in 1776, Hale is shown moments before his death, his arms and feet bound, his clothes disheveled, yet his demeanor strong and dignified.",4079.0,"Artist
