"The Net Mender, 1894, Alfred Stieglitz","In an 1899 article, Stieglitz singled out The Net Mender as his favorite of his own photographs: “It expresses the life of a young Dutch woman: every stitch in the mending of the fishing net, the very rudiment of her existence, brings forth a torrent of poetic thoughts in those who watch her sit there on the vast and seemingly endless dunes, toiling with that seriousness and peacefulness which is so characteristic of these sturdy people.” He noted that the exhibition prints were printed at the scale seen here because “the subject needs size to fully express it.”",4103.0,"Artist

"Bust of Kneeling Girl, 1911, Wilhelm Lehmbruck","Wilhelm Lehmbruck made his avant-garde breakthrough in 1911 with Kneeling Girl, an over-life-size figure whose expressive melancholy and elongated proportions established the artist’s reputation as an important German Expressionist sculptor. In Bust of Kneeling Girl, he isolated the sculpture’s most poignant passage—the pensive gesture of the tilted head—by provocatively cropping the figure at the midpoint of the breasts. Contemporary critics compared Kneeling Girl and Bust of Kneeling Girl to Gothic sculpture, at the time understood to communicate emotional and spiritual truth more directly than classical academic art. Lehmbruck debuted both sculptures at the Salon d’Automne in Paris, but they achieved their greatest impact in Germany, where the artist returned in 1914 after four years in France.",4116.0,"Artist

"24-3-86, 1986, Gerhard Richter","By applying pigment to the surface of a photograph, Gerhard Richter questions the objective reality that it seems to document. Through strokes of paint, we see glimpses of the view lying underneath and recognize the rhythmic pattern of a rippling water surface. However, the acrylic paint interferes with our perception of an illusory three-dimensional space. The painterly, multicolored impasto, juxtaposed against the smooth, finished, monochromatic image, draws attention to the photograph as a two-dimensional reproduction, stressing the photograph’s artifice.",4125.0,"Artist

"Man Bathing, 1899, Edvard Munch","With the advent of industrialization in the 19th century, a corresponding call to nature also emerged. In an effort to temper society’s growing mechanization, social commentators encouraged people to spend more time outdoors, preferably in the country. The pictures in this gallery depict bathing for recreation, exercise, and general camaraderie. Munch and Cézanne show nude men frolicking outside with other men, as same-sex nude swimming by men was socially accepted and in some spheres openly encouraged. These artists heroicize their bathers, making them the embodiment of strength, virility, and morality. Munch in particular was drawn to the subject, partially as a result of his own poor health and due to the influence of the growing Freikörperkultur (Free Body Culture) movement, which advocated nudism, regular bathing, and soaking up the sun as a part of a path to physical and spiritual renewal. On the other hand, social mores forbade women from bathing nude; Renoir’s Splashing Bather, therefore, was a product of the artist’s imagination, a carefully arranged studio construction. The symbolism of nude female bathers differed from that of men; these women embody vulnerability, provocation, and sensuality. In addition to outdoor recreation, indoor pools in and around Paris were inundated with families from the growing bourgeoisie as the physical benefits of swimming were increasingly advertised. Aquatics were championed for sport, hygiene, and pleasure. Honoré Victorin Daumier lived close by one of the most popular swimming schools for women in Paris. As a result of his first-hand observations, he produced brutally satiric lithographs that removed the veil of the ideal for both male and female bathers. His bathers are clothed in contemporary swim attire and show none of the admirable physical characteristics of bathers depicted by Munch, Cézanne, or Renoir.",4132.0,"Artist

"Mosaic Fragment with Grazing Camel, 5th century AD, Byzantine","This image of a grazing camel probably came from a larger composition with other animals that decorated the floor of a semipublic space within a private home, such as a reception or dining room. This animal is represented against a white ground decorated with florets. A bell hangs from the camel’s neck as it reaches toward an object, perhaps a vessel filled with water, at the lower right. The knobby contours of the camel’s body are accentuated by areas of shading in subtly modulated colors, including black, brown, brick red, and olive green.",4136.0,"Culture

"Untitled, 1969, Pier Paolo Calzolari","Pier Paolo Calzolari was initially affiliated with the Arte Povera (Poor or Impoverished Art) movement in Italy, which, was comprised of artists who aligned themselves with the socio-political and artistic upheavals of 1967–69. Refusing a defined, static style, stressing the need for art to be involved in real life with living substances, and demonstrating a commitment to constant change and experimentation, these artists used unconventional materials in an attempt to make the experience of art more immediately real. Calzolari’s early sculptural work often combines ephemeral organic materials—tobacco leaves, rose petals, feathers, moss, ice, and even flames—with technological ones, such as metal and neon, to reveal the conflict between the natural and the man-made. Here the Italian phrase, which translates as “In my 25th year,” adds an open-ended statement about the artist’s age to the spiral shape and tobacco leaves, which intimate a state of transformation.",4139.0,"Artist

"Composition with Red Arrow, 1918, Marcel Janco","In 1915 Marcel Janco joined fellow artists Hugo Ball, Richard Huelsenbeck, and Tristan Tzara in Zurich, Switzerland, to respond to World War I and an emerging modern media and machine aesthetic. United in this ""anti-art"" movement, Dada artists led a creative revolution that profoundly shaped the course of subsequent art. Their performances and assemblages—works made with the stuff of modern life, including newspapers, ticket stubs, mechanical parts, food wrappers, advertisements, and hat racks—were intended to provoke awareness of the conventions of life that had led to the disasters of war. Born in neutral Zurich and New York, two cities that served as independent points of origin for the movement, Dada rapidly spread to Berlin, Cologne, Hannover, Paris, and beyond.",4141.0,"Artist

"The Return, Tynemouth (recto) Study (verso), 1881, Winslow Homer","During Homer’s sojourn in England from 1881 to 1882, he rented a studio on a cliff overlooking Cullercoats Harbor, where he observed the comings and goings of fishing boats. The Return, Tynemouth depicts two fishermen who have arrived on shore in early morning. Because this watercolor was painted with light-fast pigments, it retains the pale, orange-pink washes that have faded from many of the extant watercolors he painted with fugitive red pigments; for this reason, it offers a more complete idea of his developing powers in decorative color. Homer’s study of the British Library’s drawings by Michelangelo and Raphael during this 1881-82 trip to England may have improved his skill for rendering figures in motion, which are emphasized here by the artist’s graphite underdrawing.",4144.0,"Artist
