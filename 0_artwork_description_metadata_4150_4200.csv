"Harden Hollow, 1912, Gustave Baumann","One from a series of four large prints, Harden Hollow displays the rolling hills in Brown County, Indiana, where the artist lived from 1910 to 1917. A farmer works diligently in the foreground, with buildings scattered throughout the undulating countryside, which is bathed in light that forces the eye deeper into the composition. Baumann included this work along with seven other color woodblock prints at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915, where he was awarded a gold medal.",4150.0,"Artist

"Indian and Pronghorn Antelope, 1914, Paul Manship","Paul Manship designed Indian and Pronghorn Antelope to span the length of the mantelpiece in his New YorkCity apartment. He expertly used the negative space created by the separation of the hunter and his prey to capture the drama of the hunt. The work represents a compromise between historical artistic traditions and modern tendencies toward abstraction: the smooth planes and stylized renderings recall ancient Greek statues, while the arresting linear design and suggestion of movement reflect Manship’s own innovations. Small-scale statuettes such as these were popular for interior decoration, and Manship’s style was immediately accepted by the public.",4156.0,"Artist

"Still Life No. 15, c. 1917, Marsden Hartley","Marsden Hartley turned to still-life painting throughout his career, restlessly using the genre as a means of aesthetic experimentation as he worked out new ideas, styles, and motifs. During the 1910s, influenced by the works of Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso, he produced numerous compositions, including Still Life No. 15, a spare arrangement of a white goblet holding a lone pink flower against a backdrop of cream and blue fabric. Unlike many works by Hartley from this period, which emphasize the two-dimensionality of his canvases, here he conveyed a sense of the shallow dark space behind the arrangement on its skewed tabletop. Using a dry, brushy style, Hartley suggested the volumetric presence of the objects through the shading that accentuates the form of the goblet and the deep folds of the fabric.",4171.0,"Artist

"The Bath, 1890–91, Mary Cassatt","Mothers and children were popular visual subjects long before the 19th century; it wasn’t until after the Enlightenment, however, that images of maternal undress were accepted in contexts other than the representation of Christian subjects. Beginning with the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other Enlightenment-era thinkers, people began to view childhood as a treasured moment in human development rather than a mere step to productive adulthood. As a result, children were increasingly seen as carefree, innocent, and deserving of protection. Their nudity in art was a commonly used symbol of natural purity and vulnerability.",4175.0,"Artist

"The Bath, 1890–91, Mary Cassatt","As views of childhood changed, so did ideas about the roles of mothers. Women of the upper class were encouraged to be more active in the daily lives of their children, and works in this gallery illustrate such activities as bathing, nursing, and soothing. The common use of wet nurses was increasingly discouraged, not only by male philosophers and medical doctors, but also by an emerging feminist movement. As with today’s breastfeeding advocacy, mothers in the 19th century were taught the benefits of nursing, both in terms of public health but also as a means of fostering healthy emotional and physical bonds with their children. Works in this gallery by Mary Cassatt, Lovis Corinth, Helen Hyde, and Édouard Jean Vuillard, among others, celebrate tender interactions between mothers and their young children.",4175.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Composition for a Peace Poster), c. 1950, Alberto Beltrán","Elizabeth Catlett and Alberto Beltrán were two of the most adept artists to join the Taller de Gráfica Popular in the post–World War II period, and this large, two-sheet print embodies the collaborative work that continued to be so central to the workshop’s practice, as well as the antiwar causes to which the Taller was particularly devoted during the 1950s. Catlett designed the image, and Beltrán executed the grandly scaled linocut, which was used for a poster advertising the Primer Congreso Nacional por la Paz (First National Peace Congress), held in Mexico City in May 1951. The giant protective hand—whose dramatic, surreal contrast in scale is unusual in Catlett’s work—symbolizes the resistance of the Mexican people to war and shields a group of workers and peasants, most prominently a mother and child, whose powerful pose also suggests both a protective and defiant attitude.",4181.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Composition for a Peace Poster), c. 1950, Alberto Beltrán","Español:
Elizabeth Catlett y Alberto Beltrán fueron dos de los más diestros artistas en unirse al Taller de Gráfica Popular durante el periodo de la posguerra. Este grabado de gran formato en dos hojas es muestra del trabajo colaborativo que siguió siendo fundamental para la actividad del taller, así como de su compromiso con la causa antiarmamentista, a la cual el Taller estuvo particularmente dedicado en la década del 1950. Catlett diseñó la imagen y Beltrán realizó el linograbado magistral que fue utilizado para un cartel anunciando el Primer Congreso Nacional por la Paz (México, D.F., mayo de 1951). La enorme mano protectora cuyo dramático y surreal contraste en escala no es común en el trabajo de Catlett simboliza la oposición del pueblo mexicano a la guerra y aparece escudando a un grupo de obreros y campesinos, más notablemente a una madre con su hijo, cuya poderosa postura sugiere tanto una actitud de protección como de desafio.",4181.0,"Artist

In later centuries, the stylistic exchange between Iran and China, as well as the high demand for Chinese porcelain in the Islamic world, led to the production of large quantities of blue-and-white wares in both Iran and China.
