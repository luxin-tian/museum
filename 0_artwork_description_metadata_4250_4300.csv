"Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Nero, 66 (December)/67 (December), issued by Nero, Ancient Roman","Portraits of important people appear on local currency all around the world. The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BC. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person—Julius Caesar—appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire.",4252.0,"Culture

"Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Nero, 66 (December)/67 (December), issued by Nero, Ancient Roman","Inscriptions on coins help identify the ruler. While the front side depicted the sovereign’s portrait, the back was often used to communicate the ruler’s accomplishments or aspirations. Until Late Antiquity, portraits usually appeared in profile. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, with one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how coins are created today.",4252.0,"Culture

"Pentadrachm (Coin) Portraying King Ptolemy I Soter, 285/247 BC, issued by King Ptolemy II Philadelphos, Ancient Greek","Ptolemy II used the portrait of the founder of the dynasty, Ptolemy I, on his coin. On the obverse, the aegis (a magical garment) worn by Ptolemy I alluded to Zeus as well as Athena; it was thought to protect the wearer and repel enemies, and it underscored the divine origins of the dynasty. On the reverse the eagle and the thunderbolt also recall Zeus, with whom, in the form of Zeus-Ammon, the early Ptolemaic dynasty associated itself.",4258.0,"Culture

"Animal Locomotion, Plate 758, 1887, Eadweard Muybridge","In the late 1870s, Eadweard Muybridge pioneered a method of ""instantaneous photography,"" a technique developed to freeze time by capturing motion. In order to create such sequences, he set up a battery of cameras, 24 in this instance, connected by a clockwork mechanism that triggered the shutters one by one at rhythmic intervals. Muybridge initially devised this process to clarify the movement of horses; through his experiments, he demonstrated that all four hooves leave the ground mid-gallop, thereby settling an intense debate of the era. This print of a cockatoo in flight was originally published in Animal Locomotion, a portfolio of 781 separate series that Muybridge, working under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania, created to stand at the intersection of art and science.",4262.0,"Artist

"Jupiter and Mercury with Baucis and Philemon, c. 1650, Nicolaes Lauwers","Nicolaes Lauwers engraved paintings and other compositions for many important Flemish artists, including Peter Paul Rubens. The fleshiness of the divine visitors suggests that Jacob Jordaens created the original painting. In the story of Baucis and Philemon, the elderly husband and wife opened their home to the gods Jupiter and Mercury, who were disguised as peasants, and were rewarded for their hospitality. In this scene, the vividly portrayed couple cannot yet see the gods in their true form, although the viewer can. The single goose screeches a warning (and an objection to becoming a meal), while Philemon offers Jupiter his best basket of fruit.",4277.0,"Artist

"Covered Vessel with the Principal Bird and Peccary Heads, A.D. 200/300, Maya","This beautifully modeled and incised blackware vessel was likely was once the personal possession of a Maya king, who may have used it to serve food at royal feasts or who may have presented it as a gift to a visiting lord as a sign of alliance. Its shape—a lidded dish supported by four legs—was a form frequently produced during the Early Classic period [A.D. 250/450]. These ceramics often display a consistent set of motifs, with birds on their domed lids and inverted peccary (wild pig) heads serving as supports. The artist who created this piece integrated the two-dimensional surface of the lid with its three-dimensional handle by connecting the bird’s spread wings, lightly incised into the surface, with its head, sculpted in the round. The vessel thus captures the essence of an aquatic bird floating on the surface of the water with its prey—a small fish—caught in its open beak.
Water birds and peccaries inhabited the natural landscape of the ancient Maya who associated them with the structure of the universe and the time of creation. The crest of feathers atop the bird’s head, its outstretched wings, and the bulge at the tip of its beak mark it as a cormorant. The Maya regarded this bird as a liminal being, able to traverse three distinct environments: it flies in the sky, perches on land, and hunts fish by swimming deep under water. This was considered extraordinary, signifying the capacity to commune with supernatural beings that inhabit all three layers of the cosmos—a power that Maya kings also claimed to posses. The cormorant bore many additional meanings with which these rulers wished to link themselves—for example, its association with watery realms alludes to fertility and agricultural abundance, which kings needed to ensure so that their community would survive. Water also evoked the distant mythological past, a time before the creation of the present universe when, according to Maya belief, everything was enveloped in a vast sea. The peccaries furthered these cosmic associations as they are thought to have represented the four pillars that support the corners of the world. In addition, some Maya identified clusters of stars in the constellation Gemini as peccaries. This constellation is located in the region of the night sky where the seminal event of Maya creation—the resurrection of the maize god—was believed to have occurred.
All of these formal and iconographic features demonstrate that as a vessel made for a ruler and used in his court, this work was adorned with imagery designed to express the supernatural sources of his royal authority. In their art programs, Maya kings often associated themselves with the cosmos and the time f creation, thereby affirming that their right to rule was inherent in the world and was established at the beginning of time.
