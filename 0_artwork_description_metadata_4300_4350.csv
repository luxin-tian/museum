"Chess Table, designed 1944; made c. 1949, Isamu Noguchi","This elegant Chess Table epitomizes Isamu Noguchi’s synthesis of Eastern and Western influences. The artist relied on a Surrealist vocabulary for his design, combining the soft, organic shape of the tabletop and undulating underside with a more solid, irregular base. He also looked to the gestural profiles of calligraphy—which he had studied in China in the 1930s—and to Japanese joinery techniques, which he utilized for the base’s interlocking legs. Descriptions of the table as practical for tea inspired the Herman Miller Furniture Company to begin production of the design, and the company’s 1949 catalog touted it as “ideal as a small coffee table.”",4301.0,"Artist

"The Rommel-Pot Player, c. 1630, Follower of Frans Hals","Renowned chiefly for his insightful portraits, Frans Hals also painted lively scenes of revelers and peasants at the beginning of his career. Particularly popular was his image of a Shrovetide entertainer who stirs a rommel-pot to delight a crowd of children with its screeching noise. The composition was frequently copied—this version was once given to Hals himself and later assigned to Judith Leyster, who probably worked in Hals’s Haarlem workshop about 1630. However, the painting does not show Judith Leyster’s distinctive style and should instead be considered to be the work of an unknown close follower of Hals paraphrasing his virtuoso brushwork.",4303.0,"Artist

"Saint Catherine, 1620/21, Peter Paul Rubens","Peter Paul Rubens was one of the most talented and famous artists in northern Europe in the 17th century. Throughout his career, he relied on professional printmakers to help him publicize his images, but he probably made no more than three etchings, of which Saint Catherine of Alexandria in the Clouds is most often accepted as his work. This sheet depicts the saint atop the wheel of her martyrdom, just as Rubens painted her in the Jesuit church in Antwerp (1620/21). The artist may have turned to printmaking in the 1630s, when he collaborated with Christoffel Jegher to produce 24 woodcuts, and this late state may not have been printed until after his death.",4304.0,"Artist

"Plaque with a Bishop, 1180/1200, Nicholas of Verdun","This plaque—the finest example of medieval enameling in the Art Institute’s collection—most likely formed the right half of an arch on a reliquary shrine. The bishop represented here holds a model of a church that he has had constructed in his covered right hand, symbolizing the sacred nature of this gift to God. Due to its refined style, scholars have drawn comparisons between this plaque and those of the famous Klosterneuburg retable, which was produced by the artist Nicholas of Verdun in 1181. It has also been suggested that this plaque depicts Archbishop Bruno of Cologne (921–965) holding a model of the Church of Saint Pantaleon in that city. At the very least, it is a remarkable example of the virtuosity of goldsmiths working for wealthy ecclesiastical foundations in the valleys of the Rhine and Meuse rivers during this era.",4310.0,"Artist

"Kannon Bosatsu, 12th/14th century","This figure of Kannon, the bodhisattva of divine mercy and compassion, was originally part of an ensemble of three statues depicting the Welcoming Descent (raigo), in which the Amida Buddha and his attendants descend from the Western Paradise to welcome newly deceased souls. Here Kannon leans forward and extends a lotus pedestal (now lost), on which a soul would be carried into paradise. The idea of raigo was incredibly reassuring to Buddhist devotees, who, when close to death, used sculptures and painted images to imagine this journey to peace.",4319.0,"Title

"Untitled, 1949, Louise Bourgeois","Untitled (1949) is significant within Louise Bourgeois’s drawing oeuvre because it codifies an important aspect of her early visual language. She was working on totemic sculptures when she made it, which is articulated by the drawing’s central vertical form. The hairlike strands that drape the central form are bulbous on one side and pointed like a spider leg on the other. Untitled is characterized by an immediacy of mark making; Bourgeois gesturally defined the inside of forms with quick marks of her pen. By implying a ground plane and compressing the image’s negative shapes, she created a cramped, psychologically charged interior space.",4322.0,"Artist

"Landzicht Farm: Compositional Study, c. 1905, Piet Mondrian","This drawing relates closely to a painting in the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague (25.1995) in both subject matter and style. However, it is nearly impossible to establish when the drawing was made or whether the drawing or painting came first. Prior to 1908, Piet Mondrian rarely dated his work; moreover, his artistic evolution is hard to trace chronologically since he made two kinds of work simultaneously: formally experimental landscapes and—forced by his meager finances to appeal to buyers—naturalistic scenes. Based on stylistic similarities to other works of that time, Robert Welsh, a scholar of Mondrian’s early work, dated the sheet to around 1905.",4323.0,"Artist

"Altar, Geometric Period (800–600 BC), Ancient Greek","These precious bronze objects are votives, or devotional gifts, which were offered to the gods. They come in many forms. Some are miniature sculptures of animals, primarily horses, deer, and birds. Others are items of personal adornment, including beads and brooches. Many seem once to have been attached to something else. This assemblage is characteristic of the thousands of votives that were hung from sacred trees or placed in sanctuaries around Greece. Once a shrine was full, the votives were ceremonially buried to make room for more offerings.",4332.0,"Culture

"Northwestern Terminal Tower: Exploded Axonometric Rendering of Madison Street Elevation, 1982, Murphy/Jahn Architects","Although the Northwestern Atrium Center (now Citigroup Center) meets the street as a cool, reflective waterfall of glass, this exuberant architectural rendering shows the building exploding from its foundations to expose the complex program of its base. Removed from its messy urban environment, the structure appears to float in an abstract grid, an example of Helmut Jahn’s creative exploration of the motifs, materials, and attitude of high-tech postmodern architecture. Unlike the heavy mechanics of other designers working in this vein, however, Jahn’s work evinces a touch of nostalgia for the delicate qualities of industrial architecture of the past. His Northwestern Center fuses a contemporary mirrored-glass facade with curves and articulation that recall Art Deco interiors and 19th-century iron-and-glass train sheds, an appropriate reference for this modern commuter train hub.",4338.0,"Artist

"Yellow Chamber, 1950/51, Joseph Cornell","Yellow chamber is one of the most intricate of the boxes Cornell constructed with mirrors. The white interior, with its beading and planks of wood, appears at first sight to be deserted, as does that of another box of these years, Toward the “Blue Peninsula” (1951–52, Geneva, Daniel Varenne; New York 1980–82, pl. XXVII), However, whereas the blue sky, the open cage, and the single bird‘s feather in that evocative box signal escape, in Yellow Chamber the birds are hidden or trapped, visible only in a series of mirror reflections.",4345.0,"Artist

"Yellow Chamber, 1950/51, Joseph Cornell","The “chamber” of the title reinforces the ambiguity of the interior space, which has strong associations with both architecture and a bird’s cage. It suggests both enforced enclosure—the locked chambers of fairy tales and hotel rooms (chambres). The unusual presence of two parakeets hints at a “ double room.” The spatial games Cornell played with mirrors here indeed evoke a double room with in the restricted area of the box. The title, Yellow Chamber; seems to refer to the yellow wall visible through the holes in the white wooden plank to the right (not visible in this photograph), and also hints at a particular, but unknown, story or history. The formal effect of the mirroring is to give the box an asymmetrical, rectilinear geometry, lightened and balanced by the circular elements (ring, holes, beads, springs).",4345.0,"Artist
