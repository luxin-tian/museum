"A Falconer with Two Ladies and a Foot Soldier, c. 1500","Two fashionably dressed women, a man in falconer’s garb, another man in the less ornate costume of a foot soldier, and a dog occupy an island surrounded by a flat expanse covered in an overall pattern of small flowers and plants known as millefleur. The shallow, earthy cross section visible on the front edge of the island reveals that some attempt was made to create an impression of depth. It is unlikely that this image had any particular symbolic or narrative significance; rather, it was probably the decorative qualities of the figures’ stances and costumes and the fantastical millefleur setting that appealed to contemporary viewers. Such millefleur designs were extremely popular because of their accessibility, functional flexibility, and manageable scale. This particular example is of an appropriate size and subject to have hung in the home of a wealthy family.",4354.0,"Title

"The Woman Clothed with the Sun, n.d., Jean Duvet","Duvet’s densely ornamented rendition of chapter 12 of Revelation focuses on the Virgin Mary, a resplendent figure in bejeweled robe, crown, and halo encrusted with 12 stars. Her perch on the crescent moon sets her in unflinching opposition to the seven-headed dragon opposite, and the glory of the sun’s rays emitted by her helps keep it at bay. Her charge, the infant Christ, has already been borne aloft to God the Father by angels, ensuring the salvation of humanity. Mary’s wings will allow her own escape to a higher plane, but her pious thoughts already transcend the danger.",4358.0,"Artist

"The Lion Hunt, 1621/29, Schelte Adamsz. Bolswert","Peter Paul Rubens was very particular about the prints made after his paintings, though he embraced the increased fame that they afforded him. Schelte Bolswert’s engraving of The Lion Hunt ably captures the roiling energy of Rubens’s painting. The older artist proudly discussed this painting in a 1621 letter: “I have almost finished a large picture, entirely by my hand, and in my opinion one of my best, representing a Lion Hunt, with the figures life-sized.” Given the printing process’s usual reversing effect, Rubens may have specifically requested that this engraving appear in the same direction as the painting.",4369.0,"Artist

"Pikeman Armor for an Officer, 1625/30","Half armor was worn by both foot soldiers and light cavalrymen. English Pikemen were infantrymen (foot soldiers) so named for their principal weapon, the pike, a staff that measured 16 to 20 feet in length. Abundantly studded with steel brass-capped rivets within embossed V-shaped motifs, a pikeman’s armor included a helmet (pott), cuirass (breastplate and backplate), gorget (collar), and tassets (riveted steel skirt plates attached to the breastplate). For protection, the down-turned, wide-brimmed pott was originally designed to deflect arrows away from the neck, while the tassets shielded the waist and upper thighs. The patterned breastplate with bulbous tassets reflects the style of a doublet, with a wide full skirt over bulky trousers, which was fashionable at this time. The shoulder strap reinforcement and tasset hinges suggest that this harness belonged to an officer of the English Pikemen or even a member of the English royal bodyguard—the Yeomen of the Guard.",4370.0,"Title

"Ewer, c. 1610","This kendi was then shipped to the Near East, possibly to Persia (modern day Iran), where such vessels were often adapted for use as water pipes. By the early 1600s, it had made its way to England, most likely imported by one of the East India trading companies. Additions to the piece testify to the artistry of English silversmiths: an eagle-headed spout was added to the bulbous mouth of the porcelain jug and connected by a set of hinged straps to the waist and base of the vessel. A scroll handle links the waist to the lidded cover. These additions transformed the piece into a wine ewer, allowing a prosperous Englishman to add an exquisite exotic touch to his collection of gold and silver plate.",4372.0,"Title

"The Presentation to the People, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",4382.0,"Artist

"The Pine Tree, Small Point, Maine, 1926, John Marin","Marin was interested in the experience of seeing, and at times he used painted borders to help translate a particular effect of vision. In this watercolor, the central motif is boldly rendered in strong, bright colors, the complementary relationship of blue and yellow giving the impression of sharp focus. Around the perimeter of the scene, the artist painted with water to dilute and blend pigment, blotting and wiping away the paint to create a blurry border that suggests peripheral vision or even the view through the lens of a camera. This vivid impression of the Maine environment quite literally exemplifies Marin’s statement that “there is a veil in front of the Artist / he’s got to pierce that veil.”",4387.0,"Artist

"American Costume, 1970, David Hammons","What intially appears to be a drawing or a print deriving from an incised plate or a marked surface is in actuality a direct impression of the artist’s own body with thumbprints. Addressing race and identity in this image, Hammons depicts an individual clearly not of European descent. The distorted facial features and the distinctive textures of the hair and dress imbue the portrait with an exaggerated ""primitiveness,"" which engage widely held stereotypes. The juxataposition of the title with the image creates a tension, speaking to the then expanding definition of what being an American meant and who it included.",4393.0,"Artist

"The Bath, 1905, Suzanne Valadon","Images of women washing themselves are ubiquitous in the history of Western art. The female nude in general has long been considered one of the most important subjects of artistic expression, most importantly in the form of history painting, traditionally represented in classical or biblical subjects. However, in the late 19th century progressive artists spurned traditional history painting in favor of contemporary subject matter—art of the moment that represented real life. The theme of the bathing woman became thoroughly modern. During this period, public health officials encouraged regular bathing not only for cosmetic reasons, but also as a means to combat diseases such as cholera. As a result, more and more people washed indoors regularly. Images by Edgar Degas, Félix Vallotton, Pierre Bonnard, and Suzanne Valadon, for example, show modern accouterments of indoor plumbing—large porcelain tubs and taps for running water. Though these prints and drawings allude to contemporary industrial developments and evolving societal expectations, they remain principally devoid of narrative. They depict anonymous women across a range of social classes, including some models who were probably prostitutes, in the intimate act of washing. These artists used the subject of the bathing woman as an evocative means to an end—especially Degas, who returned to the theme of the bather literally hundreds of times between the late 1870s and his death in 1917. Degas utilized bathers to explore the possibilities of the human form—employing multiple angles and viewpoints, depicting its shape and various movements, and reflecting the many colors and textures of the environment.",4399.0,"Artist
