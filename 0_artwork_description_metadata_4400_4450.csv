"Fireplace Surround, 1901, George Washington Maher","Prairie School architect George Washington Maher worked for Joseph Lyman Silsbee before striking out on his own. During this period Maher developed a system of design that he called the “motif rhythm theory,” in which he created a signature motif to harmonize the interior and exterior of a house through the repetition of decorative details based on local natural forms. He frequently collaborated with Louis J. Millet on his commissions, including the Patrick J. King House (1901), from which this fireplace surround came. This extraordinary object is composed of glass mosaics and features one of Maher’s most prominent motifs, the stylized thistle. It is delicately rendered in shades ranging from pale seafoam green to vibrant greens, blues, and yellows. The fireplace surround is an outstanding example of Millet’s exacting execution of Maher’s designs.",4401.0,"Artist

"Portrait of a Rabbit, 1867, Yabu Chosui","A large rabbit fills the entire surface of this print, indicating that it was created in the year of the rabbit. The curious, sacklike quality of the rabbit’s body is also a reference to the large white bag of Hotei, one of the gods of good fortune, who often appears on New Year visual art. The rabbit’s body is also rounded out to suggest a lopsided moon (the home of the rice-pounding rabbit), which is emphasized by its silvery outline. Finally, there is an allusion to the most common New Year symbol, the rising sun. Although the rising sun is usually represented as a luminous, round body against an orange sky, Yabu Chosui showed it as a rising lopsided rabbit against a flaming pink background.",4407.0,"Artist

"Mask for Egungun (Ere Egungun), Late 19th century, Yoruba","This mask would have been worn during the annual or biannual Egungun festival, performances and celebrations to honor lineage ancestors. In addition to their deployment during the annual festivals, Egungun masks can also be brought out at funerals for important lineage members or in times of crisis, when the guidance of the ancestors is sought. This mask depicts a figure wearing a pith helmet, a potent symbol of colonialism in Nigeria, even when worn by a non-European. The helmet is surmounted by several birds—one on the crest and five smaller ones encircling the rim—that symbolize the supernatural powers of women, sometimes understood as witchcraft. The lines incised across the cheeks, forehead, and outer corner of the eyelids represent scarification or identification marks, linking the mask to a specific lineage—perhaps that of the mask’s owner. The series of holes around the edge of the mask, through which a thin cord is interlaced, would have allowed the mask to be connected to the fabric costume worn during the ceremonies.",4411.0,"Culture

"Mask for Egungun (Ere Egungun), Late 19th century, Yoruba","The Yoruba word egungun can be translated as “powers concealed” and refers to any masked performer or masquerade. In this sense, the word elucidates a critical function of Yoruba masquerade, which is to cloak and contain otherworldly forces and to help make possible the vital interaction between humans, ancestors, and gods. Egungun is also the proper name of a masking tradition staged to honor ancestors and the newly deceased, those “Dwellers in Heaven” or “Beings from Beyond” that continue to influence the lives of their kin from orun, the otherworld.",4411.0,"Culture

"Mask for Egungun (Ere Egungun), Late 19th century, Yoruba","The Egungun masquerade originated within the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo, perhaps as early as the 17th century, and spread to other corners of the Yoruba region over time. Today, many Yoruba communities have an Egungun society—made up of adult men and women who represent the community’s lineages—that plans the appearances of Egungun masqueraders at funerals, special family occasions, and yearly or biennial Egungun festivals. During these events costumed men move through the town embodying the presence of their ancestors while songs are sung in their praise and invocations are offered to them. Through rituals lasting several weeks, the masqueraders visit lineage compounds to bless or punish their descendants; even royalty must seek their favors in order to have a prosperous year. Though women and children participate by singing, dancing, and watching, they are kept at a safe distance from the masqueraders, whose actions are unpredictable.",4411.0,"Culture

"Mask for Egungun (Ere Egungun), Late 19th century, Yoruba","Egungun masquerade costumes are commissioned and owned by men. The making of a costume involves close consultation with a tailor and sometimes a sculptor if a wooden mask or headdress is required. It also requires the assistance of a diviner, who can communicate with the spirit world; an herbalist, who makes packets of protective medicines that are attached to the costume; and the leader of the Egungun society, who performs rituals to sanctify the costume and selects the young man who will wear it while performing. Taking on the responsibility of owning a masquerade costume is demanding, but it also brings personal prestige and demonstrates a man’s commitment to his extended family, a commitment that is held in great esteem by the Yoruba.",4411.0,"Culture

"From a Wasp, c. 1914, Arthur Dove","Arthur Dove lived in France from 1908 to 1909, where he absorbed the lessons of Pablo Picasso and other avantgarde artists working in Paris at the time, including fellow American Max Weber. Upon his return to New York, Dove joined the circle of artists at Alfred Stieglitz’s 291 gallery, and he became the first American painter to experiment with pure abstraction in works like From a Wasp. Employing subdued colors, perhaps in acknowledgement of the tones of Analytic Cubism, Dove created a tightly focused, highly abstract composition that renders the curving forms of a wasp’s body as a series of overlapping planes.",4433.0,"Artist

"Autumn, from The Seasons, 1700/20, Charles Le Brun","Autumn belongs to the eight-piece series entitled The Seasons. Designed by Charles Le Brun, First Painter to Louis XIV of France, half of the compositions present two deities associated with a particular season holding a wreath encircling an activity typical of that time of year, with a different royal building visible in the background. In this design, Diana and Bacchus float on a cloud, holding a floral wreath featuring a stag hunt. Diana, the goddess of the hunt, is identifiable by the bow, arrow, spear, and horn at her feet, and is an appropriate presence in this depiction of the hunting season. Bacchus is the god of wine, which explains his presence in a representation of autumn, the time of the grape harvest. Grapes and other fruits and vegetables associated with fall can be seen in the foreground. The castle in the background is the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a royal retreat just outside Paris.",4434.0,"Artist

"Jesus Before Caiaphas, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",4436.0,"Artist

"First View of the Yosemite Valley from the Mariposa Trail, 1865/66, Carleton Watkins","In the 1860s, Carleton Watkins was the first to document the untouched wilderness that would become Yosemite National Park. Transporting his fragile equipment on mule or carriage through difficult terrain, Watkins used a ""mammoth-plate"" camera whose glass negatives measured up to 18 by 22 inches and yielded remarkably detailed prints of the same size. He favored spectacular compositions with dramatic spatial depth. In this photograph, Watkins depicted Yosemite Valley’s immense span through the receding planes of mountains and the giant Sequoia trees that frame them. Watkins printed more than 1,100 mammoth-plate photographs over the course of his career. Unfortunately, the majority of his glass negatives and prints were destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.",4437.0,"Artist

"Mixed Behavior, 2003, Anri Sala","Anri Sala has received extraordinary acclaim for a series of unconventionally beautiful, politically inflected videos. A global itinerant, he lives and works all over the world—predominantly in Berlin and formerly in Paris and his native Tirana. The artist’s short, formally accomplished works poignantly and strategically blend documentary, narrative, and autobiographical approaches, existing as minimal, ab-stract allegories of cultural suspension and transition. Concerns of immigration, exile, social alienation, violence, crime, poverty, and repression shadow all of his poetic, melancholic compositions.
Sala’s work is rooted in part in Albanian culture and history. He grew up under one of the most repressive communist dictatorships in Europe and later witnessed the tentative transition to a democratic, market-driven system before leaving to study in France in 1996. The following year, the Albanian economy collapsed under the weight of a corrupt government, bringing widespread lawlessness and violent unrest. Sala’s intensely analytical perspective has been forged by this firsthand experience of social turbulence and radical change. Confronting a traumatic history while negotiating a diasporic present, his work describes a condition of simultaneous disorientations—temporal, spatial, visual, aural, and linguistic.
Mixed Behaviour embodies the most important themes and strategies of this artist’s oeuvre, including strikingly innovative play between foreground and background, light and dark, sound and picture.1 Here, a lone disc jockey filmed squarely from behind spins records on a Tirana rooftop. It is a rainy New Year’s Eve, and the man bends to his task covered by a plastic tarp while fireworks explode all around him, briefly illuminating the darkness; their clamor overlaps with the sound of gunfire, a local holiday tradition. Gradually, we realize that the video’s soundtrack plays in manipulated synchrony with the fireworks: like the Wizard of Oz under a clear plastic veil, the DJ appears to control a scene that stretches across the background like a movie screen or canvas. However, while the music proceeds in a predictable, linear fashion, seeming to conjure the fireworks in the distance, we realize that the images are periodically moving backward; almost undetectably, the fireworks are reversing, seeming to implode. This action suggests the practice of “scratching”— rapidly and repeatedly reversing the direction of a record on a turntable. As Mixed Behaviour shows us, Sala exploits the medium of digital video so comfortably and completely that his arrangement of digital image and accompanying sound offers an astonishingly new use of filmic art.",4442.0,"Artist

"Ornament With Flower and Eight Wild Folk, 1490/1500, Israhel van Meckenem, the younger","Ornament prints with mischievous tiny figures were in such demand in late-15th- and early-16th-century Europe that engravers like Israhel van Meckenem frequently borrowed imagery and entire compositions from other artists. The flower stalk that the naked wild men and women scale comes from a print by an earlier artist, the Master E. S. This print bears an inscription that translates to “The noble bees draw honey from the beautiful flower; from this one however, the frivolous vermin extract a stronger potion.” The ripe blossom thus symbolizes sexual consummation, and the print simultaneously tempts and warns the viewer about “the birds and bees.”",4445.0,"Artist

"Standing Male Nude (recto); Classical Head (verso), n.d., Paul Emile Detouche","Life drawing from the nude was an integral part of the rigorous academic training an artist might traditionally receive in Paris and other major cities in the 19th century. Only after beginning with rote copying from prints and plaster casts after the antique would qualified, usually male, students progress to the nude model. The highly finished drawings that resulted from these sessions hearken back to Classical sculpture in their definition of relief and generally demonstrate more the respective technical aptitude of these young artists than their creative potential. Paul Cézanne and Gustav Klimt’s nudes are particularly difficult to recognize as autograph, although they underline the dramatic journey made by these artists to their mature styles. Luminous in surface handling and a tendency toward allegory, Edward Burne-Jones’ sketchbook nudes are less rigorous in their anatomical detail, while Auguste Rodin’s cropped female form floats across the page as an ode to the theme of eternal feminine. Conversely, the subject of Gustave Courbet’s Model Reading exhibits partial undress rather than complete nudity in a moment of quiet introspection between her modeling sessions.",4446.0,"Artist
