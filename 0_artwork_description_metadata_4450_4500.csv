"The Brook, 1910, John Marin","In his watercolors of rushing streams made in the Austrian Tyrol, Marin denoted hovering mists and the free-flowing movement of water over rocks by adding layers of wet color to stain the paper and then wiping them away, creating soft, ghostly areas of almost subliminal color. He conjured the shape of a shrub by subtracting pigment, perhaps with the handle of his brush, adding touches of blue to draw the eye into the haze. Cementing his reputation as a “master of mists,” the Tyrol watercolors earned Marin many new admirers and are still counted among his most important watercolors.",4453.0,"Artist

"Soldier, 1999, Luc Tuymans","Luc Tuymans’s quiet, elegiac paintings, copied from old photographs or newspaper illustrations, draw upon the act of remembrance and the function of collective memory. Describing his process, Tuymans explained, ""I usually finish [a painting] in a single day, partly in order not to lose my concentration and partly in order to have the chance not to come too close to the image I am using as my model."" Often his canvases refer to his experience growing up in Belgium, a country ravaged by war and haunted by its history of colonial oppression in Africa and Asia. Based on a photograph of a World War I soldier, this work is a haunting, strangely ambiguous partial portrait that suggests that the history of war is more forgotten than remembered.",4459.0,"Artist

"Street Scenes in Times of Peace (Taiping fenghui tu), Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), 14th centuryZhu Yu (1293–1365), Zhu Yu","This impressive handscroll depicts more than four hundred figures that together represent a broad variety of professional occupations, social types, public interactions and expressive poses. The scroll is a rare example of genre painting, seemingly newly emerged during the Song dynasty (960-1279), that took the public activities of common people as its subject-matter. The title, added in the frontispiece to the painting, literally reads “Collection of Customs during Times of Peace” (Taiping fenghui), referring to the totality of social and professional activities of a given community. The absence of an articulated background to the depiction of these activities, and their general composition around typological groups, is a feature shared with the medium of the model-book. Such painting manuals provided a collection of iconographic cartouches for copying into larger, integrated compositions. However, the particular compositional features of this scroll, including complex interaction among groups of figures, overall spatial coherence, and the nature of activities portrayed (including transportation, performance, and public sales), interestingly suggest that its horizontal pictorial surface stands here for the public space of the ‘street’. Activities portrayed include the transportation of goods, livestock, and people, commercial activities, including divinatory and clerical services, public entertainment, and even the accidental entertainment provided by a runaway donkey causing a stir. The social array of characters runs the gamut from street-beggar to scholarly recluse (with staff and servant carrying a lute), from men to women and children. Some of the hats and clothing of these figures appear to be Mongol in type, which lends additional interest to the temporal context of production of this particular painting: if painted in the Ming, the reference to the Mongol presence during the preceding Yuan dynasty adds a retrospective, historicizing note to this portrayal of public life.",4465.0,"Artist

"The Winter Sun, c. 1909, George Gardner Symons","George Gardner Symons was born in Chicago and likely began his artistic education at the School of the Art institute of Chicago. He went on to work at the St. Ives artists’ colony in Cornwall, England, where he adopted the Impressionist technique of painting en plein air. Symons traveled extensively in pursuit of artistic subjects, maintaining studios in a number of locations, including Colrain, Massachusetts, where he likely created The Winter Sun. He especially enjoyed the challenges of depicting wintry landscapes, which he largely completed outside in the elements. Symons’s approach in such mature works had a forceful breadth that critics saw as particularly American in character. Paintings like The Winter Sun thus found great favor among American audiences and museums, which acquired many of his works.",4474.0,"Artist

"Field Where General Reynolds Fell, Gettysburg, July 1863, Timothy O’Sullivan","Along with Mathew Brady and Alexander Gardner, Timothy O’Sullivan was one of the primary photographers of the American Civil War. Using wet-plate glass negatives, a cumbersome and labor-intensive technology that did not allow for images of active battle, O’Sullivan concentrated on the war’s harrowing aftermath. This photograph depicts a scene following the Battle of Gettysburg, one of the war’s bloodiest confrontations, in which thousands of men on both sides lost their lives. The lifeless, exposed bodies of the six soldiers who appear in the photograph had been picked over by survivors searching for shoes and other valuables. This image was among 44 of O’Sullivan’s photographs included in Gardner’s Photographic Sketch Book of the War, one of the first published collections of Civil War photographs.",4476.0,"Artist

"Telegraph Pole, 1929, Arthur Dove","When Arthur Dove first exhibited Telegraph Pole at Alfred Stieglitz’s gallery An American Place in 1930, the artist wrote that his painting depicted “a wet telegraph pole, some flying leaves, and silver.” He evoked the shininess of the wet pole by painting his work on a steel plate. Although he frequently experimented with metallic effects and nontraditional materials, Dove only rarely depicted such modern subjects. Here the gleam of the steel emphasizes the newness of the telegraph pole, which, with its hard geometric edges, contrasts with the timeless, organic curves of the natural landscape behind it.",4483.0,"Artist

"Portrait Head of a Woman, AD 117/30, Ancient Roman","This woman’s name is unknown, but her portrait indicates that she was likely a member of the imperial family. She wears a tall ornamental headband, typically reserved for goddesses and imperial women. Her elaborate hairstyle, with distinct locks woven around the headband, would have required the services of a skilled hairdresser. Moreover, the use of costly marble reflects her family’s wealth, while her commemoration with a finely carved portrait indicates that she was of elevated social standing.",4487.0,"Culture

"Female Helmet Mask (Ndoli Jowei), Early/mid-20th century, Sherbro","Until Sierra Leone was affected by a brutal civil war lasting from 1991 to 2002, helmet masks like the one displayed here were governed by the Sande association. Common among the related Sherbro and Mende peoples, this all-female group held important religious, political, and educational responsibilities. Masks with elaborate hairstyles, exemplifying local ideals of beauty, were performed by senior Sande officials at funerals, for visits of important guests, and during the initiation of young women into the association. This is one of the rare instances in Africa when women danced with sculpted masks.",4488.0,"Culture
