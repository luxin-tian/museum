"Tynemouth Priory, England, 1881, Winslow Homer","During his 1881-82 stay in England, Homer settled in the small fishing village of Cullercoats. He often depicted fisherfolk in the village and neighboring areas, as in Tynemouth Priory, England, in which a woman and two fishermen occupy a coble that is floating in choppy waters off the coast, and a fisherman wearing yellow gear is busy hauling in a net, presumably filled with the day’s catch. A ruined castle and priory that dominate the coast near Tynemouth are visible in the righthand background; Homer would have seen this view daily from his rented studio overlooking Cullercoats Harbor. The artist’s use of transparent gray wash for the ruins makes them appear ghostly and desolate in the mist. Overall, this work successfully captures a sense of ocean breezes and moist salt air.",4503.0,"Artist

"Museotypes, 1983, John Knight","Since the late 1960s, John Knight has utilized existing forms of distribution and communication—including magazine subscriptions, museum mailing lists, travel posters, recipes, and floor plans—to reconsider the social structures and value systems that support the exchange of ideas and commodities. By interrupting expected graphic identities, Knight’s work questions how branding and design affect the understanding of objects, and at times institutions. Museotypes depicts 60 international museums, not by their logos or facades, but as floor plans on bone-china dinner plates. In this ironically commemorative series, the plates simultaneously venerate their subjects as collectable items and reduce them to commercially available, limited-edition souvenirs. Thus, the museum is literally put on display, and as the artist explained, the work as a whole becomes ""a representation of the museum and its role in culture.""",4509.0,"Artist

"Album Quilt, 1854, Sarah Ann Wilson","Made before the Civil War, as indicated by the date inscribed in a square in the bottom row, this quilt depicts African American figures who seem to be a family. The figures are sensitively portrayed, with appliquéd and embroidered brown fabric comprising their faces and hands. The familial narrative is reinforced by the hand-and-heart motif in the bottom right corner. The specificity of the portrayal and the similarity of the figures to those in another quilt (depicted here) suggest that these figures may represent the maker’s own family. Although historians know little about Wilson, she may have been a free black woman living in New York.

The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BC. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person—Julius Caesar—appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire.",4520.0,"Culture

"Histamenon (Coin) of Romanus III Argyrus with Christ Enthroned, 1028/34, Byzantine","Romanos III Argyros (reigned 1028–34) was marked for succession to the throne by his father-in-law, Constantine VIII, whose reign lasted only three years. Romanos managed a six-year reign that was riddled with ill-conceived and poorly executed policies, including a disastrous attempt to reform taxation that left the empire’s finances in disarray and drove the less fortunate into enforced servitude. In an effort to halt the growing threat posed by Arabs along the eastern frontier, Romanos personally led the army to confront them, only to be thoroughly routed in a surprise attack. Later conquests and victories did little to improve his reputation, and he died, possibly at the hands or order of his entirely disillusioned wife, Zoe. On the front of this histamenon, the enthroned and haloed Jesus holds the Gospel book in his right hand. The inscription reads “Jesus Christ, King of Kings.” On the reverse, the Virgin Mary crowns the richly bedecked Romanos, who holds a globus cruciger, indicating that the emperor wields earthly power on behalf of the Christian God.",4520.0,"Culture

"Inhale, Exhale, 2010, Sam Buxton","London-based Sam Buxton is interested in exploring the possibilities of new technologies and materials in the service of works that reinterpret everyday objects and environments, emphasizing their component parts for renewed scrutiny. For the past ten years, Buxton has created an array of miniature environments and landscapes made from acid-etched or chemically milled steel that depict familiar environments drawn from everyday life: health-club gyms, airport waiting lounges, public plazas, outdoor cafés, and open-plan office spaces. Buxton is interest in exploring the phenomenological aspects of architecture and design and purposefully depicts the types of homogeneous environments that define our quotidian existence as a way to create work that is accessible to a broad audience and will therefore prompt investigation. For Buxton, the city is a networked data-scape in which we plug in and out depending on the activities we are assuming at any one time. The most coherent manifestation of his ideas is demonstrated in a series of recent works that play out at the scale of furniture or product design. Inhale, Exhale (2010) features a myriad of staircases grouped together in a block that is approximately 5 feet high and three-and-a-half feet in width. This piece is unsettling in its failure to provide the sense of escape that one expects from such stairs. Like much of Buxton’s work, the piece is meant to be read metaphorically as a multilayered narrative relating to daily life. Buxton has offered this explanation of Inhale, Exhale: “Every stair begins at the base and emerges onto the open surface, the entirety is therefore interconnected. The image of the staircase relates predominantly to the mind, in this case a state of mind, but it also references data, processing, and repetition. I wanted to juxtapose familiarity and presumed purpose with a claustrophobic density, a structure that can only be briefly escaped, that ultimately only leads to an inevitable re-immersion.” By creating a strong vocabulary of forms that are both familiar and unfamiliar, Buxton prompts viewers to contemplate their own relationships with the spaces and objects.",4521.0,"Artist

"Small Bathers, 1896–97, Paul Cézanne","With the advent of industrialization in the 19th century, a corresponding call to nature also emerged. In an effort to temper society’s growing mechanization, social commentators encouraged people to spend more time outdoors, preferably in the country. The pictures in this gallery depict bathing for recreation, exercise, and general camaraderie. Munch and Cézanne show nude men frolicking outside with other men, as same-sex nude swimming by men was socially accepted and in some spheres openly encouraged. These artists heroicize their bathers, making them the embodiment of strength, virility, and morality. Munch in particular was drawn to the subject, partially as a result of his own poor health and due to the influence of the growing Freikörperkultur (Free Body Culture) movement, which advocated nudism, regular bathing, and soaking up the sun as a part of a path to physical and spiritual renewal. On the other hand, social mores forbade women from bathing nude; Renoir’s Splashing Bather, therefore, was a product of the artist’s imagination, a carefully arranged studio construction. The symbolism of nude female bathers differed from that of men; these women embody vulnerability, provocation, and sensuality. In addition to outdoor recreation, indoor pools in and around Paris were inundated with families from the growing bourgeoisie as the physical benefits of swimming were increasingly advertised. Aquatics were championed for sport, hygiene, and pleasure. Honoré Victorin Daumier lived close by one of the most popular swimming schools for women in Paris. As a result of his first-hand observations, he produced brutally satiric lithographs that removed the veil of the ideal for both male and female bathers. His bathers are clothed in contemporary swim attire and show none of the admirable physical characteristics of bathers depicted by Munch, Cézanne, or Renoir.",4524.0,"Artist

A.D. 14–37) was 56 years old when he became emperor of Rome, portraits of him, such as this one, depict a conspicuously younger man. Here he is shown in profile and crowned with a laurel wreath, a symbol of victory.

This portrait was carved from a layered piece of agate with brown and white bands so that the figure of the emperor stands out against the dark background.

With these textual juxtapositions, Kruger calls out the societal pressures on women to bear children.

"Sea Movement–Green and Blue, 1923, John Marin","Mark Island, notable for its lighthouse, signals the passage from Penobscot Bay to Stonington Harbor. For this watercolor, Marin started his sketch of the island in graphite rather than charcoal, allowing for greater precision. Yet he playfully set it against the mountainous profile of Mount Desert, a view that could not in reality have been seen from the same vantage point. Marin employed a particularly expressionistic handling of watercolor here: contours are jagged and black, and the paint is heavily manipulated. An electric blue sky, animated by circular wiping, is energized by the single line of yellow marking the contour of the island. The artist’s passionate orchestration of movement, color, and mood map the fluctuation of a turbulent sea, while the reflective silver frame and mount contribute to the sense of dynamism and excitement.",4541.0,"Artist
