"The Arch of Septimus Severus, 1820, Luigi Rossini","Luigi Rossini trained as an architect in Bologna before moving to Rome in 1813, where he had more success as an artist. Following in the footsteps of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Rossini began a series of etchings of Rome’s constructed marvels. His extensive knowledge of structural design proved valuable for his accurate, detailed portrayals of sites such as the antique arch of Septimus Severus. Whereas Piranesi tended to exaggerate his scenes, Rossini remained grounded in his realistic representations. Because Rossini’s depictions are so precise, his prints serve as important records of Rome’s architectural heritage.",450.0,"Artist

"Picture of Dorian Gray, 1943–44, Ivan Albright","Ivan Albright painted this lurid portrait for the Oscar-winning movie adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s 1891 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. In Wilde’s tale, Dorian Gray commissions a portrait of himself as an attractive young man and later trades his soul for an ever-youthful appearance. As the still-handsome Gray leads an increasingly dissolute and evil life, his painted representation rots and decays, revealing the extent of his moral corruption. Albright’s renown as a painter of the macabre made him the ideal choice of Albert Lewin, the director of the movie, to paint the horrific image of Gray. Although the movie was shot in black and white, Lewin filmed the painted portrait in color to emphasize Gray’s shocking transformation.",458.0,"Artist

"Pelike (Storage Jar), about 510/500 BC, Ancient Greek","This ancient storage vessel is decorated in the black-figure technique, which was developed in Corinth and used widely during the Archaic period (700–480 B.C.). Gloss, a slip made from refined clay, was applied to all areas intended to be black. For the figural scene the silhouettes of the figures and other elements were painted in gloss, sometimes following the lines of a preliminary sketch scratched into the surface. Using a sharp tool, the artist created details by incising through the gloss to the light clay ground below. Colors such as purple-red and white, made from a gloss with mineral pigments, were then added. After a three-stage firing process applying alternately less and more oxygen, the gloss turned black. In its finest form, it was quite shiny. On this vessel, those techniques are used by the artist to create lively scenes in which a woman dances playfully with a drape of fabric, perhaps her cloak. Male musicians accompany her with Greek instruments including a Barbiton (the string instrument which looks like a small harp) and an aulos (the wind instrument shaped like a doubled flute). The inquisitive dog adds to the sense of movement and rhythym within the scene.",463.0,"Culture

"Amphoriskos (Container for Oil), 600/575 BC, Ancient Greek","Located on the narrow isthmus that joins the Greek mainland and the Peloponnese, with natural harbors facing east and west, Corinth was the major port of trade in Greece for most of the Archaic period (700–480BC).

"Column-Krater (Mixing Bowl), about 460 BC, Ancient Greek","The Greeks diluted their wine by blending it with water. The master of ceremonies at the symposium, or drinking party for men, determined the ratio of wine to water, both of which were poured into a large mixing bowl, like this one. This particular shape is called a column krater after its columnar handles. It is decorated with a mythological scene. Salmoneus, king of Elis, pretended to be Zeus by imitating the sound of thunder and the appearance of lightning. Angered at his impudence, here Zeus strikes Salmoneus dead with a real lightning bolt.",468.0,"Culture

"The Lost Pleiade, 1874/75, Randolph Rogers","In creating this sculpture, Randolph Rogers was inspired by the Roman author Ovid’s poem Fasti, which recounts the legend of the seven sister stars who lived among the constellations. Merope, the youngest sister, married Sisyphus and hid herself in shame because he was mortal. The sculpture depicts the outcast Merope as she seeks her celestial family. With its unclothed torso, The Lost Pleiade is the closest Rogers came to creating a complete nude. Although a conteporary viewers may not have understood the reference to Fasti, the title nonetheless reassured Victorian audiences that this partially nude woman had literary antecedents and was thus not intended as a sensual form.",486.0,"Artist

"Amphora (Storage Jar), about 340/330 BC, Ixion Painter","One of the first objects to enter the Art Institute’s collection, this amphora represents changes in conservation practices across different centuries. Before it was acquired by the museum in the 19th century, the vessel had broken and been repaired. The staples that hold the foot together are from this early restoration. Some fragments were missing, including important parts of the figural scene depicting the battle between the Greeks and the Amazons. Because filling in these areas would require imaginative reconstruction, these areas of loss were not restored. The lower decorative band, a uniform key pattern, was restored. 20th-century restoration with matte black plaster indicates areas of loss in the band. The fragments of this amphora were reassembled in an earlier century using pieces of other ceramic vessels, but this amphora was left intact by conservators.",488.0,"Artist

"The Bull, 1650, Paulus Potter","Paulus Potter was the preeminent animal artist of the Dutch Republic. His paintings and prints of monumentalized bulls for sophisticated court patrons in particular epitomize the beasts of the Dutch farmland. His slightly caricatured style betrayed a wry and occasionally earthy wit, which he sometimes used for political allegory. By his early death at age 29 he had created his own market niche of animal portraiture, leading the way for 18th-century artists such as George Stubbs, who would paint literal portraits of prized livestock for their proud owners.",495.0,"Artist

These icons of military prowess are surrounded by bucking horses, falling soldiers, and spears. It is ironic that Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio chose to depict the Romans as skilled cavalrymen, since the cavalry was the weakest part of the Roman army until the late Imperial Period (A.D. 3rd/4th century). The inscription at the bottom of the engraving attributes the design for this print to Raphael; it may preserve a rejected idea for his Battle for the Milvian Bridge in the Sala di Costantino in the Vatican, Rome.",498.0,"Artist
