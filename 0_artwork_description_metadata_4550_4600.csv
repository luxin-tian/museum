"Valley of the Hondo, New Mexico, 1930, John Marin","Marin made his first trip to the West in early June 1929 at the suggestion of two friends, Georgia O’Keeffe and Rebecca Strand (wife of the photographer Paul Strand). O’Keeffe’ s invitation came at a good moment, because Marin was feeling the need to explore new territory and escape what he called ""living in herds"" in Manhattan. Marin had also been tempted to visit the West by his friend the painter Marsden Hartley’s vivid descriptions of the landscape. During the summers of 1929 and 1930 Marin lived and painted in New Mexico, following the lead of several of the artists who congregated around the 291 gallery in New York. Valley of the Hondo, New Mexico was one of the group of thirty watercolors that was exhibited in 1931 at Alfred Stieglitz’s gallery An American Place.",4552.0,"Artist

"Card Table, c. 1815, Charles-Honoré Lannuier","Trained as a cabinet-maker in Paris, Charles-Honoré Lannuier arrived in New York in 1803 at the age of twenty-four. His older brother was already well established as the owner of a successful confectionary shop on Broadway and from there the young furniture maker first advertised his services to all potential clients who desired furniture in the “latest French fashion.” Early-nineteenth-century America was much enamored with French taste, and Lannuier successfully catered to his upscale clientele, tempering his designs to suit their preference even while he retained a distinctive French flair. One of a group of similar card tables, this example shares many of their decorative and design elements, including a winged caryatid central support, a Lannuier trademark.",4553.0,"Artist

"The Tale of Taishokan, 1640/80","This screen narrates the medieval Taishokan tale, an action-adventure story that captivated medieval and early modern audiences whether they saw it performed on the Noh, Bunraku or Kabuki stage, or depicted in paintings and prints. The many variants of the tale combine elements from early Japanese mythology and history; 14th-century Buddhist temple origin legend (engi) that reflects continuing anxiety about foreign invasion in the wake of the Mongol attacks of the late 13th century, and Noh play motifs.
The story unfolds from right to left, opening with a scene in and around the courtyard of Fujiwara Kamatari’s residence in the Nara area. Kamatari, the most powerful courtier of the seventh century, was the first and only person ever granted the rank of ‘Taishokan,’ the highest rank in a system used only between 647 and 685. According to legend, reputation of Kamatari daughter’s beauty made its way to China, where the emperor Taizong fell in love with her sight unseen, and asked to marry her. Kamatari’s daughter, Kohakunyo, is shown boarding her carriage to be sent abroad on the ships depicted below. Her new home, the Chinese court, is shown to the left. On the left screen, the treasures that the princess sends back to Japan, the most precious of them a jewel in which is embedded a tiny statue of the Buddha, have been entrusted to the Chinese general Wanhu. Wanhu is shown in battle with the forces of the dragon king who lives beneath the sea and succeeds in stealing the precious jewel. In the end, Kamatari (in other versions, such as the Noh play Ama [15th c.] and Chikamatsu Monzaemon’s Bunraku play Taishokan [1711], it is Kamatari’s grandson Fusasaki) enlists the help of a diver woman to recover the stolen jewel. She manages to sneak into the undersea Dragon Palace, recover the jewel, and escape—pursued by the Dragon King’s horde. Just as she reaches the surface—at the very center of the screen—she is slain by one of the Dragon King’s minions, a serpent-warrior. When the men on Kamatari’s ship recover her body, they find the jewel concealed in a slit she had cut into her chest—she had knowingly sacrificed herself, that is, to recover the precious jewel.

"Annemiek, February 11, 1997, 1997, Rineke Dijkstra","Rineke Dijkstra practices an art of quiet, engaged observation. Since she began exhibiting her photographic work in 1993, she has developed an international reputation as one of the most visible and highly regarded Dutch artists of her generation. She is known for flat, frontal, color portraits of individuals that are characterized by a remarkable formal classicism, conceptual rigor, and psychological depth. Of her work, the artist has commented, “I discovered that if you want to give a general impression, you should be very specific.” In the series Beach Portraits, for instance, she depicts her subjects within a precise geographic setting yet avoids identifying them by name.
Although video is somewhat of an anomaly in Dijkstra’s oeuvre, her earliest attempts in the medium, like her photographs, focus on the tender aspects of teenage sexuality and social behavior. For instance, both Buzz Club/Mysteryworld (1997) and Annemiek, February 11, 1997 feature subjects that were filmed alone or in groups, appearing before a blank white background. Buzz Club, however, grounds these individuals within their wider location—a nightclub in Liverpool—through the use of ambient noise as well as through their unselfconsciousness in front of the camera; although they stand in front of a screen, they continue to smoke, dance, and chew gum. In this way, Buzz Club serves as a stylistic and compositional bridge between Dijsktra’s photographic portraits and Annemiek.
Dijkstra shot Annemiek with a single fixed camera, and only the subject’s head and shoulders are visible in the frame. The work features an adolescent Dutch girl alone before the camera, lip-synching the ballad “I Wanna Be With You” by the popular American teen band the Backstreet Boys. As the music starts, Annemiek appears nervous and embarrassed, but only moments later she furrows her brow in a momentary lapse of self-consciousness, allowing herself to imitate the lyrics’ passion. Quickly catching herself, she manages a bashful smile. Throughout the video, she continues to struggle between this adolescent awkwardness and adult confidence.",4558.0,"Artist

"Seven Panels and Index, 1973, Hanne Darboven","Hanne Darboven is known for ordered notations that utilize numbers, particularly permutations of the calendar, as their systematic focus and structure. In the 1970s, she introduced transcriptions of texts (including those by Charles Baudelaire and Jean-Paul Sartre), diagrams, and abstract marks into her work. Monumental in scale, Seven Panels and Index exemplifies the artist’s practice of covering ordinary composition paper with undulating lines associated with handwriting; here her lines resemble the cursive form of the lowercase letter l. Darboven’s compulsively detailed, laboriously produced script emphasizes the process of mark making by evoking text while remaining abstract, and explores the passage of time as it is experienced both historically and personally.",4563.0,"Artist

"Bust of a Nobleman in Armor, About 1610, Pietro Tacca","This portrait bust of an unknown nobleman in armor, sporting the stiff ruff characteristic of men’s fashion in Europe in the first quarter of the 17th century, was once thought to portray the Genoese aristocrat Ambrogio Spinola or an anonymous naval officer.

He captured them at various times of the year and at different moments of the day. When these works were shown in an 1891 exhibition, they were widely praised by his peers.

"Basin Depicting a Cistern, Tower and Domed Building, 1775/1825, Talavera Poblana","Barely a decade after the Spanish conquered Aztec (Mexica) Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico City) in 1521, they founded the city of Puebla de los Angeles sixty miles to the southeast. As colonial society began to take shape, a new visual environment was called into being, supplanting the major forms of native art and affirming the cultural ascendancy of the ruling order. Ceramics became important in this endeavor, and Puebla emerged as the principal center of a thriving pottery industry that included glazed tableware, secular and religious accessories, and tiles used in architectural ornamentation. The imagery of these objects stemmed from opposite ends of the earth, reflecting a New World synthesis that came into being as the Silk Road became global.
Master ceramists from Spain settled in Puebla, bringing with them the potter’s wheel as well as tin-glazed earthenware and Hispano-Moresque ornamentation, both originally rooted in the artistic culture of the Islamic world. Indeed, a primary characteristic of the Spanish tradition can be traced to the formative period of Islamic art, which occurred between 800 and 1000. The artists, artisans, and architects charged with the task of creating a visual culture for the new faith did not immediately invent radically original forms; rather, they incorporated motifs and themes from the art of the Roman, Byzantine, and Persian empires, choosing and adapting from a variety of sources as a new imagery and aesthetic took shape.
In Mexico this inheritance, which in ceramic art placed special value on ornamentation and avoided themes fixed by religious scripture, offered an approach to incorporating another unexpected source of artistic inspiration. During the 1560s, Chinese blue-and-white porcelain, along with other Asian luxury goods, began arriving on galleons from Manila, the new capital of the Spanish Philippines. Unloaded in Acapulco, these objects were transported overland to Mexico City and Puebla—where many of them remained—before continuing on to Veracruz and across the Atlantic to Seville. Chinese wares, with their array of figurative, floral, and geometric forms, had an immediate and lasting impact. In Puebla, a new line of production began, featuring glazed earthenwares freely imitating the important porcelains while also retaining patterns and shapes deriving from the old Hispano-Moresque tradition.
The Art Institute’s basin reflects this layered artistic inheritance: the shape stems from examples made in Egypt, Syria, and Turkey; the ornament derives from Chinese designs; and the filler details spring from the Hispano-Moresque tradition. For instance, the wide, flaring rim is wreathed with pink flowers linked by leafy, scrolling bands adapted from a Chinese motif. The high wall is divided by panels featuring lobed compartments enclosing simplified Chinese peonies; the surrounding spaces are filled with dotted clusters of Hispano-Moresque origin. The exotic architectural motifs in the central medallion originate in the domed and towered buildings depicted in fanciful Chinese landscape images; here, however, the tower is converted into a fountain surmounted by a native gourd from which water cascades into a cistern. Bold design, vivid color, and playful fantasy characterize this distinctive Mexican synthesis.

MacNeil achieved a new level of dynamism that reflected the thrill of the spectacle, as described by his friend, the author Hamlin Garland: “They had rushed four miles at top speed, but they mounted the trail toward Walpi with incredible celerity.
