"The Essex Canal, c. 1896, Albert Pinkham Ryder","Albert Pinkham Ryder was one of the most innovative artists of the late 19th century, creating reductive, yet expressive compositions out of thick, slowly worked paint, combined with glazes, varnishes, and unconventional materials. In The Essex Canal, a waterway faintly meanders from the green-hued foreground to a skim of blue along the horizon, with an expansive sky beyond. A younger generation of American artists celebrated Ryder as an important early modernist, who pushed toward abstraction and focused on the arduous process of painting itself as instrumental to one’s creative vision. Ryder’s reclusiveness only added to his intrigue and mythic status as an artist ahead of his time.",4605.0,"Artist

"Nude Child Seated, 1520/30, Jean de Gourmont","Here Gourmont placed a nude child in front of his characteristic perspectival architecture, leaving only a few clues about his identity. The composition resembles both contemporary images of the Christ Child as well as the John the Baptist roundel on view nearby (1938.1502). Yet the oil lamp behind the figure and the statue in ancient garb emphasize the broken bricks and weeds growing throughout this collapsed structure. These details suggest that the roundel is a meditation on the ruins of Antiquity rather than the advent of Christianity.",4606.0,"Artist

"Plaque, 1879, John Bennett","Working at the London firm Doulton and Company, English ceramist John Bennett evolved a new method in which he painted his designs in slip, or liquid clay, and covered them with clear glaze. In 1876 “Bennett ware” was exhibited to great acclaim at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, prompting Bennett to relocate to New York. Although his early pottery demonstrates Islamic influences, this plaque is more indebted to contemporary British Aesthetic movement design. Flowers in muted colors extend into the composition from beyond the pictorial space, yielding a design that resembles the intricate textiles of English artist William Morris.",4609.0,"Artist

"The First Step, c. 1912, Constantin Brancusi","Mothers and children were popular visual subjects long before the 19th century; it wasn’t until after the Enlightenment, however, that images of maternal undress were accepted in contexts other than the representation of Christian subjects. Beginning with the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other Enlightenment-era thinkers, people began to view childhood as a treasured moment in human development rather than a mere step to productive adulthood. As a result, children were increasingly seen as carefree, innocent, and deserving of protection. Their nudity in art was a commonly used symbol of natural purity and vulnerability.",4610.0,"Artist

"The First Step, c. 1912, Constantin Brancusi","As views of childhood changed, so did ideas about the roles of mothers. Women of the upper class were encouraged to be more active in the daily lives of their children, and works in this gallery illustrate such activities as bathing, nursing, and soothing. The common use of wet nurses was increasingly discouraged, not only by male philosophers and medical doctors, but also by an emerging feminist movement. As with today’s breastfeeding advocacy, mothers in the 19th century were taught the benefits of nursing, both in terms of public health but also as a means of fostering healthy emotional and physical bonds with their children. Works in this gallery by Mary Cassatt, Lovis Corinth, Helen Hyde, and Édouard Jean Vuillard, among others, celebrate tender interactions between mothers and their young children.",4610.0,"Artist

"Approaching Fog, 1952, John Marin","This late watercolor looks outward from Marin’s home toward the tide marker rock, coastal ledges, and waters of Pleasant Bay. A somber portrait of the sea by one who understood its character intimately, the work alludes to a gradual envelopment by nothingness, aging, and death. Yet it possesses energy and excitement: splashes of green and red shimmer though the gray mists, while calligraphic black lines activate the surf and air. These marks, some applied with a medical syringe, reflect the artist’s awareness of recent developments in Action Painting. Here he blotted, scraped, and wiped pigment, combining transparent and opaque watercolor, brush and black ink, and fabricated charcoal.",4620.0,"Artist

"Woman with Halo and Sceptre, 1972, Joe Zucker","Joe Zucker is a radically inventive painter whose mature works are built, constructed, or made in emphatically material and physical terms. His most iconic and influential pieces were created by attaching cotton balls, dipped in paint and Rhoplex (a polymer used in caulks and sealants), onto cotton duck canvas. This tedious, labor-intensive process, which the artist originated, relies on the tactile, dotlike forms of the cotton balls to compose a pictorial field. Woman with Halo and Sceptre is part of a series of five paintings, each comprising the same number of cotton balls, that use images of the San Vitale Byzantine mosaics (526–48) in Ravenna, Italy, as their source material—in effect, creating a mosaic out of a mosaic.",4629.0,"Artist

"Tenth Cloth Octagonal, 1967, Richard Tuttle","For over 40 years, Richard Tuttle’s work has defied easy categorization. Utilizing a wide range of humble materials—including plywood, wire, rope, and cardboard—his objects convey a sense of impermanence. Tenth Cloth Octagonal, an early work by the artist, is the last in a series of irregularly shaped canvas octagons, which are, according to the artist, “about skin.” Importantly, Tuttle considered each consecutive version to be more eccentric and an improvement over the last. In addition to his unorthodox use of material, he provided no specifications for the orientation or installation of his cloth pieces; they may be affixed to either the wall or floor, making these works hybrid forms that the artist described as “drawings for three-dimensional structures in space.”",4633.0,"Artist

"Bow Guard (Ketoh), 1900/20, Navajo (Diné)","During the 1860s and early 1870s, Navajos (Diné) learned silversmithing from Hispanic artisans in New Mexico, and Plains Indian craftsmen whose own metalwork stemmed from Colonial sources in the eastern United States. Mexican pesos, U.S. American dollars, and ingot silver were melted down and recast in molds carved from soft volcanic tufa. Navajo silversmiths employed steel tools and punches to develop decorative patterns. Early concho belts, bow guards, bracelets, necklaces, horse headstalls, and other items of silver jewelry display massive forms and simple ornamentation. By the 1890s turquoise was increasingly used; although most turquoise was obtained from Southwestern sources, some was imported from China and Iran. Navajo silversmiths rapidly established a distinctive elegant style that has become one of the classic hallmarks of Native American art in the greater Southwest. Today, Navajo jewelry, like that of their neighboring Pueblo neighbors, exhibit much greater complexity of design and the use of diverse semiprecious stones, shell, and a variety of metals.",4640.0,"Culture

"Rack Picture for Dr. Nones, 1879, William A. Mitchell","This type of trompe l’oeil (fools the eye) painting simulates an old-fashioned bulletin board that held important, yet ephemeral documents like letters and newspaper clippings under strips of ribbon. Such “rack picture” still lifes functioned as biographical portraits, in this case for Dr. Samuel Smith Nones, the prominent Philadelphia dentist who commissioned this work. Adjacent to the central letter to Dr. S. S. Nones are envelopes addressed to medical colleagues and one to Nones’s brother. The painting’s illusionistic fragments cleverly define the dentist’s professional and personal identity, narrating a rich tale of camaraderie and achievement for an inner circle of viewers. William A. Mitchell, the father of the youngest dentist in the group, likely executed the composition.",4645.0,"Artist

"Hyacinth Awaiting His Turn to Throw the Discus, c. 1824, baron François Joseph Bosio","After studying in Rome, François-Joseph Bosio introduced a late Neoclassical style of sculpture to Paris. There he worked successively for Napoleon and King Louis XVIII on a range of public and private commissions. He also created a number of sculptures on mythological subjects—among them this treatment of the doomed Spartan prince Hyacinth—for exhibition at the annual Salons. Hyacinth was killed by Apollo in an unfortunate throw of the discus. The semi-recumbent male nude was an unusual subject for statuary, but its passive and feminized presentation here was fashionable in this period.",4647.0,"Artist
