"Standing Male Figure (Mankishi), Late 19th/early 20th century, Songye","A nkishi (plural mankishi) is a container for holding potent medicines, which when activated protects families, individuals, or communities from various ills. The medicines or ritual substances and offerings are typically applied through an animal horn inserted into the crown of the sculpture’s head or through a concave cavity in the stomach, as is the case here. As vehicles for controlling life forces, these power figures are perhaps the most important objects among the Songye, who live in the southeast region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The emphasis on the abdomen in these figures has been suggested to indicate their importance in aiding fertility. Roughly carved with a geometric rendering of the face and body, mankishi were commissioned in two basic types—as small, privately owned figures and as large figures for use by the community. Although they can be nonfigurative, the figurative mankishi are carved by sculptors and activated by a ritual specialist (nganga).",4656.0,"Culture

"Standing Male Figure (Mankishi), Late 19th/early 20th century, Songye","Both the scale and the aesthetic qualities of this sculpture indicate that it was a personal nkishi. It stands at about 18 centimeters tall, about mid-range for the personal mankishi examples, the scope of which lies between four and forty centimeters. Whereas the larger community mankishi tend to be stylistically consistent, the personal ones display a variety of aesthetic approaches. This one exhibits 13 copper tacks, malengyela (singular elengyela) inserted into holes on the head and abdomen. There are other holes on the arms and legs of the figure, which most likely were once filled with the dome-shaped nails as well. The carved genitals identify this figure as male. He stands with bent legs on a small circular base. The long splayed fingers resting on the protruding abdomen, in addition to the relatively large scale of the head in proportion to the body, reflects Songye metaphysical belief. Accordingly, the most important part of a human being is the kikudi, or living spirit, which is believed to reside in either the head or the stomach of an individual (see also 1960.906).",4656.0,"Culture

"ABC Office Building, New York City, New York, Elevation, Plan, and Model View, 1988, Bertrand Goldberg","Goldberg’s growing national reputation in the 1960s led to a large commission to design new corporate headquarters for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in New York. In order to plan the office spaces, the architect undertook an extensive study of ABC’s corporate organization and workflow. His plan included small office groups with spaces for support staff and meeting rooms housed in a series of undulating convex and concave concrete walls. The most striking element of Goldberg’s complex was an illuminated broadcasting tower adjacent to the office building—both functional element and advertising tool—that would have surpassed the Empire State Building in height. Although he demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of the design, ABC suffered a financial setback and canceled plans to build. If realized, this high-profile commission would have situated Goldberg’s work alongside landmark modern office buildings in New York by Eero Saarinen, Gordon Bunshaft, and Philip Johnson.",4657.0,"Artist

"The Morbetto, or The Plague of Phrygia, 1515/16, Marcantonio Raimondi","The subject of this print, as identified by the text on the central pedestal, is based on an excerpt from Virgil’s epic poem Aeneid, which follows the hero Aeneas on his flight from Troy to Italy after the Trojan War. In book three of the poem, Aeneas’s father interprets a message from the oracle of the god Apollo to mean that the Trojans should colonize the island of Crete. They build a city, which Aeneas names Pergamum, but are struck by a wretched plague, which brings a year of death to humans and animals. Aeneas then has a dream, as seen in the upper left, in which he learns that Apollo’s oracle intended the Trojans to occupy Italy, where Aeneas will eventually settle, becoming the ancestor of the Romans.",4668.0,"Artist

"Portrait of a Man, 1550/60, Corneille de Lyon","A Dutch-born painter who settled in the great French trading center of Lyon, Corneille de Lyon specialized in vivid, small-scale portraits. His sitters were drawn from court circles and from the upper bourgeoisie of merchants and officials; Corneille invariably depicted them against a relatively flat, jewel-toned background that permitted the viewer to focus on the acutely observed features. The body typically appears small in relation to the head, yet through silhouette and a few telling details of dress, Corneille was able to evoke the demeanor of his subjects- in this case of this unknown young man, a restrained elegance.",4680.0,"Artist

"The Descent from the Cross: Second Plate, 1633, Rembrandt van Rijn","Rembrandt’s Descent from the Cross is stylistically unusual and reproductive, unlike most of his prints, which were original designs rather than printed paintings. Rembrandt’s original oil was strongly influenced by an altarpiece of the same subject by Peter Paul Rubens. While Rembrandt likely had a hand in the making of this particular print, he was relatively inexperienced with printmaking on such a large scale, and therefore enlisted the help of engraver Jan van Vliet. This collaboration can be seen in Rembrandt’s spontaneous line and van Vliet’s heavy mechanical handling, particularly in terms of the facial expressions.",4693.0,"Artist

This example shows how the preliminary outline was done in red pigment, then corrected, and finished in black. Often these sketches were the work of two craftsmen, a draftsman and a master artist.

"Afrophoenix No. 1, 1963, Melvin Edwards","In 1960 Melvin Edwards shifted his artistic practice from abstract painting to sculpture. Three years later,
he began Lynch Fragments, a series of welded steel assemblages made in response to the tumultuous social climate of the Civil Rights movement. Edwards addressed African American identity within an abstract sculptural language. Afrophoenix No. 1, one of the earliest objects from the series, exemplifies how the artist physically transformed found objects and brought them together in poetically suggestive, tension-filled compositions. Here the formal arrangement of steel elements evokes an equestrian bridle and bit. Chains, hammers, nails, spikes, and screws magnify the sculpture’s associative power, recalling implements of labor and torture. At the same time, the title references the mythological phoenix—alluding to death, rebirth, and transformation. Suggesting a range of meanings, the work demonstrates Edwards’s desire to fuse abstraction with personal and collective histories.",4695.0,"Artist

"Green/2 Orange X Painting, 1983, Robert Mangold","Robert Mangold is an American Minimalist painter best known for painted canvases that incorporate drawn line, exalting simplified means and structure. Over the course of the last 50 years, he has employed a variety of geometric forms—circles, ellipses, squares, rectangles, trapezoids—as the support for his pared-down compositions. From 1980 to 1986, the artist created a series of paintings based on the letter X and the plus sign. Green/2 Orange X Painting is composed of three conjoined canvases of unequal size and three distinct colors—two oranges and a green. Drawn lines of unequal length mark the axis of the cross, replicating the overall shape within the plane and unifying the composition. Here the physical presence of the canvas edge becomes the central formal motif; the structural skeleton of painting becomes the subject of the work.",4696.0,"Artist

"Portrait of a Woman, 1950, Charles White","Charles White dedicated himself to portraying the African American community with dignity. Contrary to stereotypical representations of African Americans common during the postwar era, White consistently depicted his subjects as strong and proud. An immensely talented draftsman, White wanted others to be conscious of the pride he had in his people, and he believed that art was the most appropriate tool for relaying this message to the public. White focused on African American women during the 1950s and throughout his career, even devoting a solo exhibition in New York to the subject. For this show White created pieces that honored the strength of black women including works such as Harriet Tubman (1949; private collection) and Mother (1945; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). When asked about the exhibition, White explained the the African American woman deserves “a great deal more recognition for the never-ending sacrifices she has made and the continuing leadership she has given in the struggles of the Negro people for full equality.”",4698.0,"Artist

"Portrait of a Woman, 1950, Charles White","During this time, White created Portrait of a Woman, 1950, which shows a contemporary working-class African American woman. The subject’s large eyes are inviting and warm, but the noticeable bags, along with her wrinkled face, imply that her life has been hard. Plainly clothed with simply styled hair and no jewelry, she is obviously a commoner, but White’s depiction suggests that although she may not be conventionally beautiful or important, she still has her dignity. Furthermore, her striking doleful eyes address the viewer directly in a tender gaze.
Increasingly leftist in his political views, White’s admiration for the working classes is visible in his murals, his paintings, and his works on paper. White chose to focus not only on inequalities and degradation experienced by African Americans, but also the humanity and beauty he saw in them. White’s Portrait of a Woman celebrates his subject by portraying her as valuable and worthy of not only his artistic representation, but also of our respect. Through masterful renditions such as Portrait of a Woman, White offered an alternative, uplifting narrative of the African American experience.",4698.0,"Artist
