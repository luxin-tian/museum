"Portrait of Dr. William McNeill Whistler, 1871/73, James McNeill Whistler","Born in Massachusetts, James McNeill Whistler lived all of his adult life in Europe, working in artistic centers such as Paris, London, and Venice. Whistler painted this portrait of his brother William in London, where both of them then lived; the artist had established a studio there in 1859. Having served as a medical officer for the Confederate Army, Dr. William McNeill Whistler moved to the city after the Civil War and was a respected physician. Whistler modeled his brother’s face with some degree of detail, yet also employed broad brushstrokes of thinly applied paint to merely suggest the sitter’s dress, which blends into a background of flat color.",4704.0,"Artist

"Nudes in Sea, 1940, John Marin","Some of Marin’s Cape Split seascapes incorporate voluptuous female nudes, who swim, wade, and sun themselves on rocks. His models included his wife and the couple’s neighbor, though many compositions were clearly imagined. When he started this watercolor, he addressed the seascape first, leaving the seven female forms in reserve. Marin later fleshed them out in pink, with darker red shading. He used black crayon to define the figures’ broken contours, underscoring each nude with a heavy, shiny black line to anchor the bodies on the rocks. Two horizontal lines in the sky seem to symbolize the unity of ocean and women in this world of abundant beauty.",4715.0,"Artist

"Shinto Deity in the Guise of the Monk Hyeja, 11th/early 12th century","This figure is said to represent the seventh-century Korean monk Hyeja, the foremost spiritual teacher of the first great Japanese patron of Buddhism, Prince Shotoku Taishi (573–621). The sculpture was made in the ichiboku technique, utilizing only a single block of wood. Its dramatic power is enhanced by the artist’s use of the natabori method of carving, in which the chisel marks are clearly visible on the surface. Here Hyeja looks as if he has been chipped away; his devotion to Buddhism and consequent asceticism have reduced him to a frail figure.",4723.0,"Title

"Shinto Deity in the Guise of the Monk Hyeja, 11th/early 12th century","This work reflects the coexistence of Shinto and Buddhism. In Japan there was a belief in honji suijaku, a theory that Shinto deities (kami) were manifestations of Buddhist deities. This principle was also applied to historical figures like Prince Shotoku, and less commonly to individuals like Hyeja.",4723.0,"Title

"Bacchante with Infant Faun, Modeled 1894, cast after 1894, Frederick William MacMonnies","As one of the nation’s most important sculptors of the Gilded Age, Frederick William MacMonnies garnered many public and private commissions at the turn of the 20th century. Bacchante with Infant Faun, however, was not created on commission. Instead, MacMonnies gave the life-size version of the bronze to his friend the architect Charles McKim. The sculpture was soon at the center of a public scandal when McKim attempted to give it to the new Boston Public Library. Some among Boston’s elite chafed at the mythical figure’s nudity and her drunken dance. MacMonnies’s naturalistic modeling—bones, muscles, and even teeth convincingly rendered—challenged Victorian sensibilities. McKim eventually gave the statue to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Bronze reductions, such as this one, nevertheless remained popular with the public.",4730.0,"Artist

"Crypt, 1945–47, Adolph Gottlieb","In 1941 Adolph Gottlieb began a series of paintings and drawings called Pictographs. The pictographs represent the artist’s first efforts at reconciling elements of abstraction with an exploration of the unconscious drawn from Surrealism. His aim was to create a new, uniquely American expression that would bring significant content to abstraction. The ideas Gottlieb explored in Pictographs are so varied and complex that the series occupied him for more than 10 years. Crypt was created in the course of Gottlieb’s intensive exploration of the pictograph theme.",4732.0,"Artist

"Tree and Mountain Forms, Delaware River Country, 1916, John Marin","Marin painted this watercolor in the fall of 1916, while staying at Echo Lake, Pennsylvania, near the Delaware Water Gap. He worked so vigorously that bristles from his brush remain embedded in the paint. Experimenting with subtractive techniques, he gave the resulting marks a prominence equal to that of a brushstroke. Repeatedly rewetting some passages, he used extensive blotting and scrubbing to create ghostly effects that conjure nature’s fleeting changes.",4734.0,"Artist

"Storm in Umbria, 1875, Elihu Vedder","Between 1867 and 1875, Elihu Vedder painted numerous scenes of Umbria, a region in central Italy that lies roughly halfway between Rome and Florence. These works integrate characteristic features of the area—wide basins and river valleys flanked by the Umbrian-Marchigian Apennine mountain range—with pastoral details such as goatherds and dramatic atmospheric effects. Since the early 19th century, numerous American artists had traveled to Italy to further their artistic educations and to experience the history of European art. Vedder continued this tradition by finding inspiration in Italy’s varied landscape and rich traditions.",4735.0,"Artist

"thaw, 2001, Doug Aitken","Doug Aitken’s acclaimed video installations take aim at what it means to live in an age when human experience is increasingly shaped by the mediating effects of technology and an unprecedented degree of mobility. Many of his videos unfold as journeys through desolate places in which the natural and the artificial begin to blend. Others offer technology-inflected visions of landscapes in a state of flux. Aitken described his body of work as a series of “structures which move outward in different trajectories and yet share a connection.” He went on to say, “If I create a work which is intensely human, then maybe the next work I want to make is as far from that as possible. It is a constantly evolving process of point and counterpoint.” The three works by Aitken in the Art Institute’s collection—monsoon, thaw, and the moment—vary in their formal qualities and subject matter, but they all pursue similar themes. Additionally, they provide a sense of how Aitken has used the spatial configurations of his multichannel installations in increasingly ambitious ways to extend his films’ narratives beyond the edges of the screen.
Another of Aitken’s voyages—in this case to a glacier in Alaska—inspired thaw, which depicts a landscape that is austere and seemingly free from the touch of human history. In this three-channel projection, expansive views of moving clouds and bright sun give way to images of melting snow and sheets of ice breaking off into the exposed sea. Perhaps first and foremost, thaw is an overtly sensual experience, filtered through and heightened by technology. At times, the images on the angled, adjoining screens merge to create an expansive panorama, while at other moments Aitken inverts an image to produce a disorienting effect or introduces an unexpected sensation of rhythm by juxtaposing close-ups of cracking ice or water droplets. Meanwhile, the layered, pulsing audio track contributes to a sense of volatility and movement, amplifying the quality of technological mediation as one views the glacial landscape. For the audio, the artist recorded ambient noises on location and later combined them with additional sounds that he synthesized electronically. Presenting a fractured, kinetic portrait of this place, he conveys through largely formal means the hidden dynamism of the arctic terrain as it shifts between solid and liquid states.",4738.0,"Artist

"Coat of Arms with Lion and Rooster, c. 1503, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer’s imaginary coat of arms is one of the Art Institute’s finest impressions, with a great delicacy of line and range of tonal values and textures. Though he produced a number of literal portraits as well as abstract family crests, Dürer’s over-the-top treatment of the flowing drapery, and the seemingly living symbols—crowing rooster, and lion rampant— on the crest and shield suggest the artist enjoyed taking a stale iconographic convention to its extremes.",4744.0,"Artist
