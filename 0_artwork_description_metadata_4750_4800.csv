"By the Rushy - Fringed Bank, 1932, Edward McKnight Kauffer","Edward McKnight Kauffer often changed his style to suit aposter’s subject. This work does not say anything about how and when to use the Underground. Rather, the company had it created simply to please those entering or passing by a station where it was displayed. One of four posters illustrating lines from English poets, it uses washes of color to create a landscape evocative of John Milton’s verse.",4756.0,"Artist

"Emiliano and Eufemio Zapata with their Wives, 1911, printed 1970s, Hugo Brehme","Known for idyllic landscape photographs, Hugo Brehme produced a body of work central to the romanticizing cultural imaginary of early 20th-century Mexico. In 1911—just a year after Emiliano Zapata, leader of the struggle for peasants’ rights, joined other insurgent forces to start the Mexican Revolution—Brehme photographed the iconic Zapata brothers as they passed through Cuernavaca with their army. This image was published for the first time in the Mexican periodical La Semana Ilustrada in June 1913, and is the only known image to show the support given by the brothers’ wives. Later prints of the image, such as this, were toned in sepia to mimic the look of older photographs and sold as souvenirs in street markets. Zapata remains a popular figure in Mexico today, and this image continues to exert its influence as a symbol of justice through revolutionary action.",4760.0,"Artist

"Dancing Brush, 1990, Toshiko Takaezu","Toshiko Takaezu studied ceramics at Michigan’s Cranbrook Academy of Art under the ceramic pioneer Maija Grotell. Takaezu’s experiments with traditional, practical shapes led her to create elongated, bulbous sculptures with no openings. The artist finished these unconventional forms with equally novel firing methods. As a highly skilled and sought-after instructor, Takaezu taught in many prestigious ceramics programs, and by the early 1980s she had access to sizable kilns at Skidmore College in Saratoga, New York, where she taught summer workshops. With access to these expanded facilities, she experimented with large structures that could reach well over six feet in height. These works became a canvas for Takaezu’s gestural brushstrokes; here her deliberate and spare application of glaze achieves the same emotional potential as Abstract Expressionist painting.",4764.0,"Artist

"Italian Family Seeking Lost Baggage, Ellis Island, 1905, Lewis Wickes Hine","Beginning in 1905, Lewis Hine began trekking to Ellis Island to photograph immigrants entering America through the New York port. His purpose was to show newcomers to the United States as dignified individuals rather than anonymous masses of foreigners, as the press frequently portrayed them. Hine went on to develop a form of documentary photography that advanced social reform and at times even resulted in changes to the law, as seen most famously in his images of child labor. In this photograph of an Italian family, Hine likened the mother to a Madonna figure, employing Renaissance art to evoke the sympathy of his viewers.",4766.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Collage #36), n.d., Joseph Cornell","Cornell worked on both the front and back of this masonite board. Based on the inscription, he preferred the side made of collaged color photographs, showing a female figurehead emerging from a tree-shaded garden, and regarded it as the front. Cornell‘s usual practice in his boxes was to work all surfaces, and he often extended this practice to his collages, which are, like this one, frequently double-sided.",4786.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Collage #36), n.d., Joseph Cornell","His preference in this case for one side over the other throws light on what it was that Cornell regarded as “successful.” He may have been aiming to achieve similar effects by different means on the two different sides of this collage. Broadly speaking, we could locate these effects with in the Surrealist notion of depaysement, that is, the disorientation of the viewer, through the displacement and odd combination of familiar objects and settings.",4786.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Collage #36), n.d., Joseph Cornell","On the front, the sculpture of a woman is set in a wood land garden, composed of tree trunks, azaleas, Japanese maples, and shade-loving flowers in the foreground nature, in other words, carefully tended in it s luxuriance. The carved figure of the woman is probably a ship‘s figurehead, though the raised arm and flowing hail also recall French allegorical images of Liberty. She “sails” across the woodland floor like a galleon, thriving on the disorientation of place, on being “out of her element,” and enhancing, by her association with the sea, the green underwater atmosphere of the wood. She also resembles the type of eighteenth-century, animated garden statue seen, for example, in the park settings of Jean Antoine Watteau‘s paintings.",4786.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Collage #36), n.d., Joseph Cornell","The other side of the collage inverts this idea. Here, “nature” is trapped inside the glass jar—not just in the form of a still life (nature morte, or dead nature) of grapes and other fruits, but in the form of a “live” linnet as well. The watch face set into the bottle just below the stopper also reinforces a connection with Joseph Wright of Derby’s Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump (1768, London, National Gallery; Judy Egerton, Wright of Del’ by, London, Tate Gallery, 1990, exh. cat., no. 21, ill), in which a dove is placed within a glass jar and sacrificed to a timed scientific experiment in a vacuum.",4786.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Collage #36), n.d., Joseph Cornell","Cornell may have thus preferred the front because the sense of enclosure, of nature trapped, was too complete on the back. The sense of depaysement, which he planned to achieve through contrasting effects on both sides, was too disturbing, conceived in terms of life and death. In the woodland scene on the front, Cornell was able to achieve a gentler kind of disruption by emphasizing what links rather than separates the images.",4786.0,"Artist

"The Valley of the Shadow of Death, 1855, Roger Fenton","Prominent in photographic circles and favored by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Roger Fenton was commissioned to document the British military during the Crimean War; his pictures there represent one of the first uses of photography in wartime. He spent March through June 1855 with the troops, producing 360 wet-plate glass negatives in his horse-drawn darkroom. The laborious process and lengthy exposure times precluded photographs of battle, yet Fenton captured the psychological intensity of war in pictures such as The Valley of the Shadow of Death. A superficial sense of barren calm is belied by the numerous Russian cannonballs, which cover the ground to indicate past violence and suggest imminent future danger in the area. Fenton exhibited this and related images in London in the fall of 1855, provoking enormous public interest, and he published them in portfolio editions.",4788.0,"Artist
