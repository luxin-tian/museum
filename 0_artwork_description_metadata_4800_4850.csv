"Movement No 24–Pertaining to Deer Isle–The Road, 1927, John Marin","Marin described Deer Isle as “a place of lovely spots and bad spots.” The joyful coloring here suggests that he delighted in this scene. Telephone poles dance over the rise alongside a zigzagging road, illustrating the artist’s consciousness of “the wonderful everlasting road a leading onward a dipping a rising a leading up over the hill to the sea beyond.” Two important variations in Marin’s approach to mounting and framing can be seen in this and the adjacent watercolor. He eschewed the gilded mounts he had previously favored, instead applying a very thin silver strip around the edge of the sheet and toning the outer margin with a coordinating watercolor wash.",4801.0,"Artist

"Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, from Les Génies de la Mort, 1870, Edmond Guilliaume","After the creation of the German Empire, Wilhelm I was named kaiser (emperor) of the unified German state. He is thus depicted as the aristocratic twin to his prime minister, Otto von Bismarck. Edmond Guilliaume ironically gave Wilhelm a crown of leaves like an ancient hero, but that association is superseded by the rest of his face and body. Underneath his confident eyes lies a decaying skull, and his body is replaced by the rapacious, blood-sucking form of a bat. Combined with the nighttime destruction of the church in the distance, Wilhelm represents the very essence of the coldhearted, cold-blooded enemy.",4804.0,"Artist

"The Outlook, Maine Coast, 1894, Winslow Homer","The Outlook, Maine Coast depicts two young women bracing themselves against the wind on a high overlook at Prout’s Neck, Maine. Rather than focusing on what the women are watching, Homer chose to explore the act of looking. Homer, a keen and thoughtful observer himself, was fascinated with the experience of watching. In this watercolor, he associated visual observation with physical sensations: the feeling of strong breezes, moisture in the air, and the chill of an overcast day. Because it allowed Homer to work outdoors quickly, watercolor was the perfect medium to make these atmospheric effects tangible and immediate. In The Outlook, Maine Coast, Homer was especially successful in creating the sense of moving air. The low vantage point also contributes to the emphasis on the windy sky of gray and pink clouds.",4807.0,"Artist

"Ocean and Rocks, 1917, John Marin","In 1917 Marin painted some of the most abstract watercolors of his career, influenced in part by an exhibition that year of Georgia O’Keeffe’s watercolors of simplified natural forms. In this and related works, the artist developed a nontraditional technique: he manipulated charcoal with a rag, which he rubbed and wiped through a semidry charcoal wash. Painting a mixture of powdered charcoal and dilute black watercolor over pale washes, he wiped horizontal and circular marks to suggest rock formations. The charcoal particles in the wash clumped as the wash dried, leaving a gritty pattern as they settled into the valleys of the textured paper. Marin’s choice of a stepped frame enhances the dynamism of water washing across rocks.",4817.0,"Artist

"Carbon and Carbide Building, Chicago, Illinois, Perspective Sketch, 1927–28, Burnham Brothers, Architects","Designed by the sons of Daniel H. Burnham, the leading commercial architect in Chicago, the Art Deco Carbide and Carbon Building represented a stylistic departure from office buildings in the Neoclassical style, which had dominated the city since the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition. The Burnham brothers clad the tower in polished granite and dark-green and gold terracotta, in keeping with the bold, often exotic materials used in Art Deco design in the 1920s and 1930s. This high decorative quality was intended to set the office building apart from its neighbors, to serve, in the words of the company, as a “distinctive and perpetual advertisement” for the building’s occupants. The low angle of this perspective sketch emphasizes the tower’s soaring height, as it looms over pedestrians and cars on Michigan Avenue.",4820.0,"Artist

"Perseus Starting from the Cave of the Gorgons, c. 1816, Henry Fuseli","Fuseli’s unfinished painting depicts the ancient Greek hero Perseus, son of Zeus, a demigod who slew Medusa, the snake-haired Gorgon whose glance turned men to stone. On the ground lies the decapitated body of Medusa, above which the airborne Perseus flees with her head, which retained its deadly power. Medusa’s two sisters, at right, unsuccessfully attempt to stop Perseus.
The painting’s source was the ancient Greek poet Hesiod’s the Shield of Heracles (translated into English in 1815), an imagined description in verse of the scenes found on Heracles’s beautifully crafted shield, including Perseus slaying Medusa.",4842.0,"Artist

"Soap Bubble Set, 1940 (reworked 1953), Joseph Cornell","Joseph Cornell’s box constructions present highly personal reflections on art, nature, history, and memory through the unexpected juxtaposition of found objects and printed material. Here he included glasses, pipes, and round disks to recollect the youthful activity of blowing soap bubbles. Their placement in front of a diagram of the Copernican planetary system, however, suggests a more universal significance. Cornell produced other Soap Bubble Set boxes, and he later recalled about them that “Shadow boxes become poetic theatres or settings wherein are metamorphosed the elements of a childhood pastime. The fragile shimmering globules become the shimmering but more enduring planets—a connotation of moon and tides.”",4843.0,"Artist

"The Annunciation, 1484/1519, Circle of Andrea Mantegna","One of the very few Italian tapestries to survive from before the 1540s, The Annunciation depicts the archangel Gabriel announcing to the Virgin Mary that she will bear the son of God. This is one of the most sacred events in the Christian faith, as it is the very beginning of Christ’s life and the Incarnation of the Word. The scene is charged with symbolism: the moment of conception is represented by the dove—standing for the Holy Spirit—in the sky between Gabriel and Mary; the archangel holds a lily, a symbol of purity; and in the near foreground are a guinea fowl and a peacock, both of which signify immortality, and two doves that represent the souls of the blessed. The coats of arms at the top belong to Francesco II Gonzaga (1466–1519), marquis of Mantua, and were added at an unknown date after the initial weaving had taken place. Such personalization of tapestry acquisitions was typical among noble families.",4848.0,"Artist
