"Armor for Heavy Calvary (Cuirassier), about 1610","This harness represents one of the last vestiges of fully armored cavalry, known as cuirassiers, trained to charge the enemy with a lance. By the 17th century firearms dominated the battlefield. In response to this development, the armorer of this piece made the breastplate and helmet thicker to resist the impact of musket fire. The dent on the breastplate, visible under the right arm, is a ""proof mark"" made when the armorer fired a musket at the piece to guarantee to his client that the armor was indeed shot-proof. Remarkably, the small size and girth of this armor suggest that it was made for a teenage boy for use either in training or in actual war, perhaps to accompany his father on a military campaign.",4858.0,"Title

"Standing Academic Male Nude (recto); Sketch of Upper Arm (verso), 1816, Eugène Delacroix","Life drawing from the nude was an integral part of the rigorous academic training an artist might traditionally receive in Paris and other major cities in the 19th century. Only after beginning with rote copying from prints and plaster casts after the antique would qualified, usually male, students progress to the nude model. The highly finished drawings that resulted from these sessions hearken back to Classical sculpture in their definition of relief and generally demonstrate more the respective technical aptitude of these young artists than their creative potential. Paul Cézanne and Gustav Klimt’s nudes are particularly difficult to recognize as autograph, although they underline the dramatic journey made by these artists to their mature styles. Luminous in surface handling and a tendency toward allegory, Edward Burne-Jones’ sketchbook nudes are less rigorous in their anatomical detail, while Auguste Rodin’s cropped female form floats across the page as an ode to the theme of eternal feminine. Conversely, the subject of Gustave Courbet’s Model Reading exhibits partial undress rather than complete nudity in a moment of quiet introspection between her modeling sessions.",4859.0,"Artist

"Standing Academic Male Nude (recto); Sketch of Upper Arm (verso), 1816, Eugène Delacroix","The diminishing influence of the Academy, and its advocacy of realistic painting, infused a short-lived periodical, Le nu esthètique (The aesthetic nude). Produced shortly after the emergence of photography helped nudge painting toward greater abstraction, this publication offered decoratively laid-out photographs of female, male, and child nudes in varying poses and allegorical guises, purportedly for artists to study from life. No corresponding paintings are known, but the ultimate academician Jean-Léon Gerôme’s introduction suggests its audience was intended to be a new generation of academic painters.",4859.0,"Artist

"Conflagration of the Masonic Hall, Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1819, Samuel Jones","On March 9, 1819, Masonic Hall, built just 8 years earlier, burned to the ground. A Philadelphia publisher commissioned artists Samuel Jones and John Lewis Krimmel to create a composition of the fire’s devastation for distribution as a print (etched by John Hill). Circulation of such sensational events was an early 19th-century means of broadcasting news, expanding the reach of fine arts, and making a profit. Jones painted this work, which served as a study for the print. Krimmel, the nation’s first great genre painter, was hired to refine and amplify the figural scene in the foreground. As the print’s composition reveals significant changes to the figures, it is unknown if Krimmel executed any of the figures here, or if he developed his designs wholly apart from this painting.",4869.0,"Artist

Like Victor Higgins and Walter Ufer, Henderson enjoyed the financial support of Chicago industrialists. Unlike his two colleagues, however, Henderson was rejected by the Taos Society of Artists; in response, he formed a Modernist group, the New Mexico Painters, in 1923. Ready for the Fiesta displays Henderson’s reliance on strong, decorative shapes and color, and the flattened picture plane and intensified geometry of the design are a result of his time spent in France studying the work of Paul Cézanne.",4871.0,"Artist

"Nelson Algren Pauses after Another White Sox Loss, Chicago, 1950, Art Shay","“A lifelong White Sox fan, Algren suffered through their misfortunes as nervously as any Cub fan of our own age. As a kid he had lived through the Black Sox scandal and knew the details well enough to write authoritatively about it. Once he and Studs Terkel were passengers in my 1949 Pontiac. I can still hear them groaning about “The Swede,” an unlikely culprit, and the verbal fencing over the batting averages of the Black Sox and their fates. Studs would eventually script and appear in the definitive Black Sox scandal movie: Eight Men Out. It became Algren’s pleasure to take Simone de Beauvoir to ball games. He was charmed by her fixation on the way ballplayers scratched their genitals and by their body language in general. He especially loved her misreading the score as “114,000,523 to 026,000,112.”’

"Still Life, 1911, Max Weber","In Still Life, Max Weber rendered diverse objects in a complex and dynamic arrangement. The calligraphic handling of line energizes the individual elements, and the short, choppy brushwork breaks the pictorial space into planes. Inspired by the works of Paul Cézanne as well as his friendship with Pablo Picasso, he was one of the earliest American artists to explore Cubism. He had met the Spanish artist in Paris while studying there in 1905–8, and at that time acquired one of his still lifes—which became the first painting by Picasso to enter the United States when Weber returned to New York.",4875.0,"Artist

"Parallel Manipulation, 1977, Christina Ramberg","Christina Ramberg is known for enigmatic paintings of fragments of the female body—typically torsos, legs, and hands—tightly cropped and partially clothed, bound, or veiled. The formal clarity, stylized figuration, and references to Surrealism and popular culture in her works aligned her with the Chicago Imagists, who she exhibited with in the False Image exhibitions at the Hyde Park Art Center in the late 1960s. The artist’s pointedly feminist critique of the social conditions that physically shape and constrict the female body was furthered by her interest in costume history and her collection of medical illustrations, paper dolls, and fashion advertisements. Her focus on patterning and clever use of juxtaposition are expressed in Parallel Manipulation, in which a head of braided hair mimics the decorative designs of a woman’s garment.",4877.0,"Artist

Working with cartographers and natural scientists, O’Sullivan documented lands unexplored by non-Native Americans, providing highly detailed photographs such as this image of Canyon de Chelly in northwestern northeastern Arizona, which had been continuously inhabited by the Anasazi and Navajo for nearly 5,000 years. Here O’Sullivan depicted the White House ruins, the striations of the canyon wall, and two small figures below, conveying the site’s monumental character. Although O’Sullivan’s famously sparse views are considered by some as forerunners to the modernist aesthetic of the early 20th century, such documents were likely intended only to imitate the graphic simplicity of maps and charts.",4894.0,"Artist

Concerned with harmonious arrangements of color and form, the artist was less interested in depicting the details of Carlyle’s face.
