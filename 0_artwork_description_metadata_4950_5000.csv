"Portrait of Édouard Manet, 1867/1880, Henri Fantin-Latour","The composition of this drawing is identical with that of the elegant portrait that Fantin-Latour made of Manet in 1867, also in the Art Institute. The controlled and very finished appearance of this work is characteristic of the drawings Fantin-Latour made after paintings for reproduction in the illustrated press. Indeed, it was drawn as a souvenir of the painting to accompany an article devoted to Manet at the time of the exhibition of his paintings and pastels at the galleries of La Vie Moderne.",4950.0,"Artist

"Figure of a Seated Chieftain, 100 B.C./A.D. 250, Nayarit","Large terracotta figures were made to accompany the remains of high-ranking people in ancient West Mexican tombs. Figures are often found in male-and-female pairs, likely commemorating the marriage of the deceased. Nayarit artists also depicted other major rites of passage, such as the presentation of a baby, the initiation of warriors and chiefs, young women reaching the age of courtship and marriage, and funerary rites. Such tomb figures testified to the earthly status of the deceased, qualifying the individual as a venerable ancestor-spirit expected to intercede with cosmic forces on behalf of the living community.",4956.0,"Culture

"La Rue de la Vieille Lanterne: The Suicide of Gérard de Nerval, 1855, Gustave Doré","Gerard de Nerval was a French poet who anticipated the Symbolist movement in his fascination with dreams as a reflection of the supernatural. Destitute and distraught over a thwarted love, he hung himself from a lantern post in 1855. Gustave Doré’s lithograph provides a fitting pictorial memorial to the poet’s hallucinatory vision and tragic end. Never pulled in an edition, the lithograph is very rare; it marks the culmination of Doré’s work in the medium. After 1855, the young artist began to rely on professional engravers while he turned increasingly to painting.",4957.0,"Artist

"Star-Shaped Tile, Ilkhanid dynasty (1256–1353), 13th century, dated c.1262, Islamic","These star and cross-shaped luster tiles were originally part of the dado (lower part of the wall) decoration of the mausoleum of a holy man in Varamin, Iran. Tiles in these two shapes were fitted together to form a continuous panel of decoration. Appropriate for a religious context, each tile features vegetal patterns framed by Qur’anic inscription and is devoid of figural representation.These tiles belong to a larger group of about 150 luster-painted tiles attributed to the mausoleum in Varamin. All 150 tiles are either star or cross-shaped, and they share many typological affinities, such as the use of rich brown luster, the inclusion of Qur’anic scripts, and the predominant appearance of vegetal motifs and arabesques. By the end of the 19th century, all tiles had been removed from the mausoleum by European collectors.",4965.0,"Culture

"Untitled (Fashion Helmet), 1982, Richard Prince","Around the time he made this piece, Richard Prince was watching lots of movies that he rented from a World of Video store. Asked by a store employee what he did for a living, Prince answered that he was a thief—a statement whose possible truth belied its apparent irony. From 1977 until 1984, Prince presented as his own work rephotographed advertisements from magazines. Liberated from their initial context, the images, or details of images, took on a fantastic quality, one that kept in play the aura of desire, money, and power fuelling all consumer culture while adding dimensions of instability and true freedom that consumerism is designed to repress. In this photograph fashion sheaths its wearer like a condom, making a man-part out of a woman while cloaking manliness in a feminine accoutrement. Copyright infringement, an act of thievery in legal terms, is the most obvious but not the greatest transgression accomplished by Prince’s appropriation of publicly circulating photographs, an interest he retains to this day.",4970.0,"Artist

"Celia L. Marriott Apartment, Chicago, Illinois, Isometric, 1983, Krueck & Olsen","The Painted Apartment was designed as a spatial experiment for an art collector who asked the architects to design an apartment that would allow her to live within a painting. Instead of incorporating works of art as discreet objects on walls or pedestals, this modern design follows in a long tradition of artist- and architect-designed spaces as immersive spaces for art, or Gesamtkunstwerk, including Art Nouveau interiors or Kurt Schwitters’s Merzbau. Here, Krueck created a series of screens and built-in, biomorphic furniture to create a dynamic division of space in the apartment. Through the layering of perforated metal screens, glass block walls, and veils of painted dots on glass walls and the floor, surfaces appear to merge and flow, a quality that is emphasized in this remarkable ink presentation drawing of the space. Like work by László Moholy-Nagy, the Painted Apartment can be viewed as a large work of kinetic art, or an environmental machine for art.",4976.0,"Artist

"Psyche’s Entrance into Cupid’s Palace from the Story of Psyche, 1756/63, François Boucher","A delicate lilting sensibility suffuses this tapestry inspired by ancient Roman mythology. Beautiful young attendants of the gods and goddesses, known as nymphs, play music to celebrate the arrival of Princess Psyche at Cupid’s palace. Cupid, the god of love, hid Psyche from the envious gaze of his mother, Venus, the goddess of beauty and fruitfulness. The graceful forms of the nymphs’ bodies complement the soaring architecture of the palace interior. The flower garland wrapped around the column, as well as the lush folding of the figures’ garment and the rug, further enhance the sensorially rich world the tapestry depicts. Unsurprisingly, contemporary operatic interpretations of the story of Cupid and Psyche influenced François Boucher’s design.",4981.0,"Artist

"Heritage of Motherhood, 1904, Gertrude Käsebier","Although she began making photographs only at age 37, Gertrude Käsebier’s evocative images of marriage and motherhood quickly attracted Alfred Stieglitz, who published five of her first prints in his quarterly journal Camera Work. A founding member of his Photo-Secession movement, Käsebier staged simple, painterly compositions and produced exquisite handmade prints in the Pictorialist tradition. In this portrait, her friend Agnes Lee sits alone before a rocky landscape, grieving the recent death of her daughter. Drawing from her own unhappy marriage and experience as a mother, Käsebier staged a contemporary Lamentation scene, though its abstract title suggests a more universal statement about the trials and sorrows of motherhood.",4984.0,"Artist

"Ravioli Chair, 2005, Greg Lynn","Internationally renowned architect Greg Lynn interpreted his version of classical upholstered furniture with his Ravioli chair. Known as a pioneer in the field of digital architecture, Lynn applied the same working methods and processes to expand his work into the field of industrial design, with the belief that the tools and techniques of architectural production can be translated into the design of products. Utilizing digital software, he manipulated the form of a flat square to create volume and mass to develop a piece of furniture. The fiberglass-reinforced construction of the chair is comprised of two shells with a curving perimeter designed to interlock with an ottoman. When used en masse, the chairs make a continuous undulating plane. The bulbous massing that forms the chair is highlighted by the color variations on the surface of the chair’s upholstery.",4989.0,"Artist

"Heraldry, 1934, Kurt Seligmann","Born in Switzerland, Kurt Seligmann moved to Paris in 1929 and began exhibiting with the Surrealists, though he did not officially join the group until 1937. Heraldry was one of the works included in the 1938 International Exhibition of Surrealism held at the Galerie Beaux-Arts in Paris, the most elaborate of all the Surrealist shows and the last major exhibition mounted by the group before its artists fled into exile during World War II. The painting reveals Seligmann’s interest in medieval and Renaissance heraldic imagery, and among the earlier titles that he inscribed and then crossed out on the back of the work is Homage to Urs Graf, a reference to the eccentric Renaissance printmaker, goldsmith, and designer.",4993.0,"Artist
