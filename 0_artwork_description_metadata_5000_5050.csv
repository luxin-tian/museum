"Wittenberg Reliquary Book (Wittenberger Heiligthumsbuch), 1510, Lucas Cranach, the Elder","Lucas Cranach produced this souvenir catalogue to promote the prized collection of relics and reliquaries of his patron, Elector Frederick the Wise of Saxony. Copies were printed on paper and more luxurious vellum, although the paper printings are now scarcer. The sequence of woodcuts walks pilgrims through every stage of the yearly viewing; each relic offered a hundred days of indulgence. Pilgrims witnessing them all would have amassed an impressive 500,500 days (1,371 years) of respite from Purgatory. Yet Frederick’s protégé, the radical Martin Luther, would soon speak out against the practice of granting indulgences, and the relic collection would be shown for the last time in 1522. The pages visible here depict Mary Magdalene’s hair, nineteen particles of Saint Cecilia, and other relics.",5004.0,"Artist

Stored in a shrine when not performed, the mask’s carved features and real animal attachments such as horns and quills create a composite entity whose powers derive from the natural world it references.",5011.0,"Culture

"Rocky Coast, c. 1860, John Frederick Kensett","Like the Impressionists, who emphasized light effects, painters of the Hudson River School focused on temporal conditions of the landscape to suggest specific atmospheres. In Rocky Coast, John Frederick Kensett depicted the shoreline on a hazy day, with calm water and gentle waves. The careful treatment of nature by the Hudson River School artists has been linked to the writings of Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote in Nature (1836): “Standing on the bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball. I am nothing. I see all.” The horizon line of Rocky Coast illustrates this idea, as the uninterrupted water appears infinite, suggesting that the ocean continues beyond the vision of the viewer.",5021.0,"Artist

"Reine de Joie, 1892, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec","Indicative of the troubled relations between the upper-class and working-class inhabitants of Paris, Reine de joie displays Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s artistic daring and interest in social commentary. Intended to promote a novel of the same title by Victor Joze, the lithograph comprises bold expanses of color illustrating a scene in which the two main characters have reached an agreement about the nature of their relationship. The man, a well-known banker, has agreed to offer the woman access to his wealth in return for nothing more than her company. This scenario provides an interesting twist on the usual transactions that took place between wealthy men and their lower-class female counterparts.",5022.0,"Artist

"Ragged Island, Maine, 1914, John Marin","This aptly named island—a mound of stone, pine, and rocky cliffs in Northeast Casco Bay, just a few miles west of Small Point—prompted Marin to move away from the literal representation of space. Without differentiating cliff from shoreline, the tipped-up composition provides no perspective, generating a sense of vertigo held in check by a peaceful blue sea. The sea was created by adding excess blue, then tilting the paper, encouraging the wash to pool and dry along the rocks. Marin emphasized the flat patterning of the composition by selecting a wide, flat frame for this work.",5039.0,"Artist

This coin was struckafter Antony and Cleopatra had married and joined forces to fight Octavian. A year later, in 31 B.C.
