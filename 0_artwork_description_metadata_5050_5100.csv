"Tea Drinking Under the Wutong Tree, Ming dynasty (1369–1644), 1509, Tang Yin","Generations of Chinese intellectuals and Buddhist monks honed the practice of tea tasting into a high art form. The ""bamboo stove"" —a carrying case that contained a ceramic kettle used for heating water—was central to the process of tea preparation. This ingenious device, fanned by a servant in the center of this painting, was the subject of a poem by Wu Kuan (1435-1504), a close friend of Tang Yin. In this composition, Wu appears on a low platform with a teapot and a scroll by his side. He shared the tea ceremony with a Buddhist monk, while another servant draws fresh water from a nearby stream.",5053.0,"Artist

"Tea Drinking Under the Wutong Tree, Ming dynasty (1369–1644), 1509, Tang Yin","Five years after Wu Kuan’s death, Tang Yin executed this delicate vignette in the writer’s memory. The first colophon was written by Zhu Yunming (1461-1527), a famous poet and calligrapher who exchanged tea-related verses with Mr. Wu. Such commemorative paintings provide poignant records of Chinese intellectual and cultured society.",5053.0,"Artist

"The Flagellation, 1475/85, Israhel van Meckenem, the younger","Prolific engraver and copyist Israhel van Meckenem produced this original Passion series without recourse to prints by contemporaries such as Martin Schongauer or Master E. S. Although these prints are compositionally complex, his figures remain rooted in the Gothic style. This sensibility is particularly evident in the violence of the Flagellation scene, in which Christ’s torturers wield their implements vehemently. A much-collected series, The Passion survives in at least 40 complete sets, some hand colored and some even gilded.",5059.0,"Artist

"Chous (Toy Pitcher), 440/420 BC, Ancient Greek","Toward the end of the 5th century B.C., Athenian potters and painters created a large number of miniature oinochoai (sing. oinochoe), or pitchers, decorated with children at play or imitating adults. It is thought that they were given to the youngest members of the family during the Anthesteria, a three-day celebration of the new vintage of wine and the arrival of spring. These little vessels are called choes (sing. chous), which means libations, after the name of the second day of the festival. Children took part in the festival but did not imbibe wine. On this example, a half-grown youth grabs the branch of a leafless tree with his left hand and extends his free hand to welcome a younger boy pulling a small cart.",5060.0,"Culture

"System of Architectural Ornament, Plate 13, Interpenetration, 1922, Louis H. Sullivan","By 1922 large commissions had grown scarce for famed architect Louis H. Sullivan, as clients began to choose formal Neoclassical styles over his highly individual, organic architectural vocabulary. Nevertheless, his circle of friends—including members of the Burnham Library committee, the Cliff Dwellers Club, and the American Institute of Architects—understood the true importance of his work and raised money to commission Sullivan to produce a series of plates illustrating his philosophy of architectural ornament. Sullivan firmly believed that architecture’s capacity for emotional expression was rooted in ornament, as a locus of human intellect and creativity. Completed in the last year of his life and exhibited at the Art Institute shortly before his death in 1924, this project—with its twenty exquisitely detailed final plates—ranks among the most important statements on modern architecture ever produced.",5061.0,"Artist

"Girandoles, 1848/51, Cornelius and Company","Gilt girandoles adorned countless parlor mantelpieces and tables in mid-19th century American homes. These particular girandoles refer to James Fenimore Cooper’s Last of the Mohicans, which tells the tragic story of the Mohawks and their attempt to rescue a young white woman abducted by a renegade Huron. The central candelabra shows Chief Chingachgook seated on a log, next to Natty Bumppo, whom he raised to manhood. Behind them stands Chingachgook’s son, Unicas.

"Still Life, San Francisco, California, c. 1932, Ansel Adams","Known for his depictions of a pristine and majestic American west, Ansel Adams broke from the prevalent Pictorialist techniques of the time to pursue a new direction in photography. Embracing a modern depiction of the world with the full tonal range possible in photography, he co-founded Group f/64, named for the smallest aperture on a camera lens, which secured the sharpest focus. Adams, after consciously deciding to dedicate his career to photography in 1930, had already produced some of his most iconic images of nature by the time he made this still life. Not originally intended for publication, it served as an exercise in composition and application of available light sources, and as Adams noted, ultimately acted as a “pleasant reminder of an aesthetic experience.”",5077.0,"Artist

Dismantled in 1573, the altar was one of a number of improvements in the church instituted by Cardinal Guillaume d’Estouteville, archpriest of Santa Maria Maggiore during much of the 15th century. As his name implies, Isaia came from a family of stone carvers in Pisa and was active in Rome from 1428. He produced a number of tombs and altars there, although the majority no longer survive. Between 1455 and 1458, he collaborated on one of the grandest sculptural projects of the century, the Arch of Alfonso I of Aragon in Naples.",5086.0,"Artist

"Fragment of a Portrait Statue of a Man, 2nd century AD, Ancient Roman","Beginning in the 1st century A.D., it became increasingly popular among well-to-do Roman men to represent oneself in the guise of a Greek mythological hero. Such portraits, which typically paired a muscular, youthful body with a more mature, realistic portrait head, were intended to equate the individual’s achievements and admirable qualities with those of the favored hero. This statue likely alluded to the Greek hero Diomedes, who played a pivotal role in the Trojan War by stealing the Palladium, a wooden image of the goddess Athena thought to protect the city of Troy from danger.",5098.0,"Culture
