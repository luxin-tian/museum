"Amor Caritas, Modeled 1897, cast after 1899, Augustus Saint-Gaudens","Augustus Saint-Gaudens was a leading sculptor of the Gilded Age. This elaborately draped, angelic female figure is the culmination of Saint-Gaudens’s studies of allegorical figures, which included similar designs for both the Edwin D. Morgan tomb in Hartford, Connecticut, and the mantelpiece in the house of Cornelius Vanderbilt II in New York. Amor Caritas (Angel of Charity) probably depicts Davida Clark, the artist’s mistress. Saint-Gaudens often depicted angels, as did many other late 19th-century artists, to symbolize the perceived virtues of women. The sculptor brought a level of naturalism to his ideal figure, particularizing the facial features and rendering the drapery so that it appears to fall atop the human form beneath.",5101.0,"Artist

"The Offering of the Boar’s Head, from The Story of Meleager and Atalanta, 1673/86, Jan Leyniers","The Story of Meleager and Atalanta is based on the version of the legend that appears in Ovid’s Metamorphoses. Meleager was the son of Oeneus, the king of Calydon. One day the goddess Artemis, enraged by Oeneus’s failure to honor her appropriately, sent a wild boar to ravage Calydon’s fields. Meleager organized a hunting party to kill the animal. Atalanta, the daughter of the king of Arcadia, was the only woman in the group. As soon as Meleager laid eyes on her, he fell in love. Atalanta wounded the boar with an arrow and Meleager killed it with a spear. The prince honored the princess for drawing first blood, declaring her queen of the hunt and offering her the boar’s head. Meleager’s uncles were jealous, and tried to steal the trophy. Blinded by love and rage, Meleager killed them. The tapestry shows Meleager returning the boar’s head to Atalanta.",5103.0,"Artist

"Flowers of the Four Seasons, Ming dynasty (1368–1644), 1599, Chen Jiayan","The artist of this softly monochromatic handscroll evokes the passage of time with plants that bloom in sequence throughout the four seasons. The flowers of spring—tree peony, spring cymbidium, astor, peach, iris, and rose—flow into summer, beginning with the white magnolia (yulan) and crab apple (haitang). Together, these last two flowers comprise a rebus or visual pun for the auspicious phrase “yutang fugui:” “wealth and rank in the Jade Hall.” The Jade Hall alludes to the Hanlin Academy, a government bureau where esteemed scholars were appointed to compile documents for the imperial court.

"Hydria (Water Jar), 360/350 BC, Ancient Greek","In ancient Greece it was considered uncivilized to consume undiluted wine, so water was fetched from a public fountain house in a large handled jar like this one and used to dilute large quantities of wine. The horizontal handles made it easier to carry, while the vertical handle at the back was used for pouring. On the front of the vessel, six female figures are arranged around a funeral momument, topped by a tall white pillar. Some of the women are standing while others are seated, and hold objects like fans or caskets for precious objects. Below the handles on the sides of the vessel, the painter has added two owls.",5131.0,"Culture

"Still Life #41, 1964, Tom Wesselmann","A leading figure of Pop Art, Tom Wesselmann approached contemporary American culture in terms of classical art-historical genres, like the nude and the still life. His early still-life assemblages, begun in 1962, melded painted forms with readymade objects and popular advertising images, creating a tension between the real and the depicted. A trip to a retail display manufacturer specializing in decorative objects inspired Wesselmann to have objects made in plastic from wooden molds and then painted and placed onto Formica shelves. Still Life #41 features both flat and dimensional objects. Removing identifying brands and labels, the artist emphasized the formal qualities of these purified, isolated shapes. Here the wooden facade of a 1930s table radio, a plastic half orange, and a plastic beer bottle become timeless, ironic icons.",5133.0,"Artist

"Nelson Algren, by his Favorite Division St. Bar, Chicago, 1949, Art Shay","“Here Algren has just emerged from losing yet again in a Division Street poker game. In this game his dealer was the legendary dealer/heroin addict Bill Hackett. Algren’s favorite short story of his Chicago oeuvre was “How The Devil Came down Division Street.” It was a fanciful jaunt of a doomed immigrant alcoholic down a wild street in the Algrenian imagination. “Oncoming evenings” (as Algren called them) were always special for him as a writer. In his classic 1951 essay, Chicago: City on the Make, he limned “the great city’s night colors,” “its ceaseless dramas lived out behind blind doors, and the jargon-tongue of Chicago’s as spoken in our Saturday night dance halls, bookie joints and courts.”’
