"Buildings, One with Tower, 1910, John Marin","Here Marin positioned himself looking south on Broadway toward Saint Paul’s Chapel and the Singer Building. He abandoned his earlier staccato, dotted application of color; instead, he chose a paper of heavier weight and texture and used more water, forsaking any preliminary graphite guide and allowing his washes to bleed into one another as in the Tyrol watercolors painted in the summer of 1910. Marin’s encounters with modern New York were intensified by his discussions about art with Stieglitz at 291. There he became acquainted not only with Stieglitz’s atmospheric photographs, but also with those of Edward Steichen and others in their circle whose emotive pictures of clouds, rain, snow, and steam encouraged him to pay attention to observation under different environmental conditions, as explored in this sheet.",5151.0,"Artist

"Geinrust Farm: Close Frontal View, c. 1905–06, Piet Mondrian","Because Piet Mondrian depicted this specific farm no fewer than 13 times, determining when he actually made this drawing is difficult. Prior to 1908, he rarely dated his work; moreover, his artistic evolution is hard to trace chronologically since he made two kinds of work simultaneously: formally experimental landscapes and—forced by his meager finances to appeal to buyers—naturalistic scenes. Based on stylistic similarities to other works of that time, Robert Welsh, a scholar of Mondrian’s early work, dated the sheet to around 1905-06.",5153.0,"Artist

"Rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Geneviève near the Intersection of Rue LaPlace (Rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Geneviève prés de carrefour de la rue LaPlace), 1865/69, Charles Marville","Beginning in 1862, Charles Marville served as the official photographer of the city of Paris, documenting the radical reconstruction of the city under Napoleon III’s Prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann. In a process that became known as Haussmannization, many of Paris’s narrow medieval streets were demolished in order to make room for the wide boulevards and public parks for which it is now known. The city commissioned Marville to photograph the areas slated for destruction as well as the modern amenities, such as gas lighting and commercial kiosks, that would become fixtures of the new urban landscape. With a corpus of more than 400 photographs, Marville produced a remarkable document of Paris in a time of epochal transition.",5155.0,"Artist

"West Street, New York, 1910, John Marin","On this sheet, Marin improvised with his fingers, touching in dots of black, blue, red, and yellow among the wheels of horse carts and trucks rendered in sketchy graphite and purple wash. These small, expressive dots bear the ridges of his fingerprints and appear as partial, repeated marks that at some times suggest movement and at others operate more as punctuation marks, accenting the scene and contrasting with the more rigorously rendered buildings. These touches of bright pigment on white paper act as musical notes skittering across a score, suggesting the interplay of sight, sound, and movement.",5157.0,"Artist

"Chasuble Front with Orphrey Cross, Chasuble: 15th century; Orphrey Cross: 1401/50","The Roman Catholic Church dictated that all chasubles, the principal vestment worn by bishops or priests to celebrate mass, be made of silk, the most espensive and precious of all fibers.

"Miscegenated Family Album, 1980/94, Lorraine O’Grady","As an artist of African, Caribbean, and Irish descent, Lorraine O’Grady has mainly focused on representations of black female subjectivity, often through the lens of family, literary, and art-historical narratives. Her work combats the elimination of difference across a spectrum of social concerns, while championing the positive values of hybridization. Miscegenated Family Album is a series of diptychs, each containing an image of the ancient Egyptian queen Nefertiti paired with a corresponding image of the artist’s deceased sister, Devonia Evangeline O’Grady Allen, or members of their respective families. The physical resemblances between the individuals within any given diptych are sometimes startling. Both families, in fact, reflect the consequences of generations of cross-cultural exchange and interracial marriage.",5177.0,"Artist

"St. John on the Island of Patmos, 1550/60, Jean Duvet","Also known as The Revelation of Saint John the Evangelist, this engraving shows the writer at work within a resplendent church interior rather than on a remote island. The book in his lap reads “In the beginning was the word,” the first verse of his gospel. The evangelist appears with his eyes shut, hand pressed to his brow as he searches for the next line. Inspiration cannot be far away, for John’s attribute, the eagle, is perched on his shoulders, giving him a borrowed pair of wings, with the Holy Trinity hovering in the air above to observe his progress.",5178.0,"Artist

"An Allegory of Abundance, c. 1515, Cristofano Robetta","This engraving depicts a seated female figure holding a staff surmounted by an urn filled with flowers, fruit, and wheat, similar to the urn traditionally held by Ceres, the Roman goddess of the harvest. The child grasping the figure’s breast in a fertility gesture suggests an alternate identity, that of the earth goddess Tellus. Robetta rendered the rocky terrain with heavy clusters of undulating curves, a technique likely inspired by early-16th-century engravings by Albrecht Dürer. The cartelliño suspended from the tree originally held the artist’s signature, but this was scored through before an impression had been printed for some unknown reason.",5186.0,"Artist

"Sadie Pfeifer, a Cotton Mill Spinner, Lancaster, South Carolina, 1908, Lewis Wickes Hine","In 1906 the National Child Labor committee hired Lewis Hine, already known for his photographs of immigrant families arriving on Ellis Island and steelworkers in Pittsburgh, to document scenes of child labor. In a South Carolina cotton mill, Hine discovered 48-inch-tall Sadie Pfeifer and photographed her directly next to the dangerous machinery that she faced each day. Though she is bathed in light, her small form is nearly overwhelmed by the rows of spools in front of her, their repeating forms evoking the monotonous, mechanical nature of factory work. Hine’s images originally appeared in periodicals, posters, and booths at anti-child labor conventions. In 1914, 35 states ruled to prohibit the employment of children under the age of 14 and to require an 8-hour workday for individuals under 16. These photographs, therefore, represent one of the first instances of photography helping to enact social change.",5198.0,"Artist
