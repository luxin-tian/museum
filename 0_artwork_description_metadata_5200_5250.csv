"Vajradhara Buddha Seated Holding a Thunderbolt (Vajra) and Bell (Ghanta), 15th century","This silver ﬁgure, though adorned like a bodhisattva, is more likely the Buddha Vajradhara. It probably served as the center of a three-dimensional mandala. The Buddha sits in the meditation posture while holding a vajra (thunderbolt) and bell in a gesture known as vajrahumkara (the adamantine sound). Certain sects of Himalayan Buddhism consider Vajradhara the creator and supreme power. He is the originator of the Five Transcendental Buddhas and embodies shunyata (voidness).",5207.0,"Title

"Untitled (Ocean), 1968, Vija Celmins","Vija Celmins’s subtle reworking of a photograph has imbued this oceanscape with an intimacy in perspective and a univesal timelessness in feeling. She effaced the perpetual flux and infinite quality of the ocean by narrowing the field of vision; by truncating the scene, she isolated a segment of an otherwise vast panorama. A variety of lead densities produces the soft monochromatic forms of the undulating water. Celmins eliminated color and compositional devices, producing a field of pattern and texture-a process evincing the naturalist landscape and abstract expressionist traditions that influenced her work.",5208.0,"Artist

"Drawing Room Cabinet, 1871/72, Bruce James Talbert","This drawing-room cabinet was conceived by Bruce James Talbert, a prolific designer in Victorian Britain who drew inspiration from such widely divergent sources as Gothic architecture and Japanese art. Like many of his colleagues in the second half of the 19th century, Talbert often wrestled with how to foster fine design and craftsmanship in the face of increasing industrialization and mechanization. He simplified and popularized the Gothic style first advocated by Augustus Pugin earlier in the century, and offered his designs to furniture manufacturers such as Gillow and Company of Lancaster, who made the Art Institute’s cabinet.",5233.0,"Artist

"Academic Nude, Seen from the Back, 1862, Paul Cézanne","Life drawing from the nude was an integral part of the rigorous academic training an artist might traditionally receive in Paris and other major cities in the 19th century. Only after beginning with rote copying from prints and plaster casts after the antique would qualified, usually male, students progress to the nude model. The highly finished drawings that resulted from these sessions hearken back to Classical sculpture in their definition of relief and generally demonstrate more the respective technical aptitude of these young artists than their creative potential. Paul Cézanne and Gustav Klimt’s nudes are particularly difficult to recognize as autograph, although they underline the dramatic journey made by these artists to their mature styles. Luminous in surface handling and a tendency toward allegory, Edward Burne-Jones’ sketchbook nudes are less rigorous in their anatomical detail, while Auguste Rodin’s cropped female form floats across the page as an ode to the theme of eternal feminine. Conversely, the subject of Gustave Courbet’s Model Reading exhibits partial undress rather than complete nudity in a moment of quiet introspection between her modeling sessions.",5234.0,"Artist

"Academic Nude, Seen from the Back, 1862, Paul Cézanne","The diminishing influence of the Academy, and its advocacy of realistic painting, infused a short-lived periodical, Le nu esthètique (The aesthetic nude). Produced shortly after the emergence of photography helped nudge painting toward greater abstraction, this publication offered decoratively laid-out photographs of female, male, and child nudes in varying poses and allegorical guises, purportedly for artists to study from life. No corresponding paintings are known, but the ultimate academician Jean-Léon Gerôme’s introduction suggests its audience was intended to be a new generation of academic painters.",5234.0,"Artist

"Still Life with Mouse, New York, 1947, Irving Penn","In a career that spanned almost 70 years, Irving Penn produced groundbreaking work in the overlapping industries of fashion and fine–art photography. Still life played a central role for Penn, from his very first cover for Vogue in 1943 (an image of an arrangement of fashion accessories) to photographs made near the end of his life of vessels that he and his wife, Lisa Fonssagrives–Penn, had collected during their travels. An homage to the domestic interiors of 17th–century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, Still Life with Mouse is one such early example of Penn’s interest in the still–life genre. Vogue art director Alexander Liberman asked Penn to compose “the most symbolic picture of a farm kitchen” for a January 1948 “farm” issue of House and Garden. The published image was a cropped version of this photograph, in color, that included a model seated at left.",5235.0,"Artist

In this work, Arnold juxtaposed scenes from the turbulent 1960s against a color palette evoking the American flag; stenciled letters suggest a framework for reading images of the Great Migration, a Jim Crow sign, violence against African American youth, war protests, Mayor Richard J.
