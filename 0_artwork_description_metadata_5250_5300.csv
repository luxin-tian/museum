"Seed Jar with Sikyatki Motifs, 1895/1910, Nampeyo","Since historical records have been kept, Pueblo potters have been almost exclusively women. There is every reason to expect that this has always been true. Nampeyo became the most famous potter who revived Hopiceramic art around the turn of the 20th century. Drawing upon archaeological Sikyatki shapes, colors, and motifs, Nampeyo created her own inventive designs, continuing the Pueblo tradition of resynthesis and renewal. Today her descendants Dextra Quotskuyva Nampeyo and Fannie Nampeyo carry on the tradition, along with many other excellent potters throughout the Pueblo world.",5250.0,"Artist

"Chair (Chitwamo or Njunga), Late 19th/early 20th century, Chokwe","This miniature wooden chair would have been owned and used by a chief or dignitary. Designed for easy transportation, its form and construc-tion derive from 17th-century Portuguese imports. Three-dimensional sculptures on the rungs and on the top of the seatback typically relate to Chokwe everyday life and mythology. The sculpted head that crowns this seatback represents a chihongo mask: a symbol of wealth, virility, and authority.",5251.0,"Culture

"The Fall of Man, 1509, Lucas Cranach, the Elder","In this scene from the biblical story of Adam and Eve, Eve is tempted by the serpent above her head to pluck forbidden fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. By consuming the fruit, Adam and Eve disobey God, who punishes them with toil, pain, mortality, and exile from Eden. Lucas Cranach here emphasized Eve’s responsibility for the Fall by depicting her as dominant over Adam and the animals in Eden. Eve stands over her submissive husband, supplying him with fruit while encircling his effeminately rounded shoulders with her arm.",5274.0,"Artist

"Sienna, 1999, Cecilia Edefalk","Cecilia Edefalk’s work, almost always a serial exploration of a single motif, is distinguished by frequent experiments with duplication, scale, and proportion. All of the artist’s paintings emerge from a relationship to other modes of representation. For Edefalk, sculpture, notably historic statuary, has been a catalyst that she has consistently reinterpreted in order to reflect on experiences that bind her to a particular work. At one point in her career, she traveled to Italy, where she became fascinated by a Quattrocento statue, a polychrome wood angel for an Annunciation. This led her to create a series of paintings, including the haunting portrait Sienna. Although Edefalk considers this an independent composition, it marks the close of the series and aims to capture the mystical qualities she prized in the statue.",5276.0,"Artist

"Center Table, c. 1755","The table is made of mahogany, which was imported to England from Central America and the West Indies. The dense and fine-grained nature of the wood made it suitable for carving in relief, as can be seen in the virtuoso carving of the table’s freize and legs. The legs have been shaped as rams’ heads with scrolling horns in high relief and swags of vines suspended from their mouths. Like goats, rams were traditionally associated with Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, and thus revelry, indicating that the table was probably intended for a dining room or banquet room.",5278.0,"Title

"Young Couple Threatened by Death (The Promenade), c. 1498, Albrecht Dürer","The foreboding, corpselike figure of Death with an hourglass appears in many Northern Renaissance prints; in this engraving, he peeks out from behind a tree, holding his hourglass aloft. Each image is a reminder that death strikes the young, the Christian, and the chivalric alike; no one outlasts or avoids death. There is an evident connection between death and sensuality in this image, underlined by the suggestively positioned and sized sword.",5282.0,"Artist

"Virgin and Child, 1350/75","This ivory statuette with its gangly Christ Child and rather plain-faced Virgin seems far removed from the aristocratic figures produced in Paris, which was a great center for the production of Gothic ivories.

"Cloudy Sky, Mediterranean Sea, 1857, Gustave Le Gray","Trained in Paris as an academic painter, Gustave Le Gray gained renown for his revolutionary process of photographing seascapes. Because of technical limitations, photography could not satisfactorily depict sky and sea simultaneously; in a single image, the sky would appear washed-out, while the water looked too dark. Le Gray resolved this shortcoming by combining two negatives (one for sea and one for sky) made at different exposure times. Although this solution represented a manipulation of photographic technique, rather than being understood as duplicitous, it was seen as an expansion of the medium’s possibilities. Looking back at the most significant accomplishments in photography of 1857–58, Marc-Antoine Gaudin, a critic for the journal La Lumière, proclaimed Le Grey’s seascapes ""the event of the year."" This photograph was originally bound with others in a single album, Vistas del Mar, comprising an extremely rare collection of these seascapes.",5298.0,"Artist
