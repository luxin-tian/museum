"Model Field Cannon (Serpentine), 1595, Hans Reischperger","Coiled around the front end of this cannon barrel is a serpent, reflecting the cannon type (serpentine), a medieval weapon with a relatively long barrel and light construction. In the 16th century, large artillery were given names of birds of prey or other predatory animals, such as falcon, serpent, or basilisk. Following this tradition, the Renaissance artist who made this piece used the surface of the barrel as a ground for applied and relief decoration—standing lions, fire-breathing dragons, striking serpents, arched dolphins, heraldic devices, and symbolic representations of classical Roman and Greek heroes. In addition to the serpent, the artist sculpted twin handles as dolphins. Cast in relief on the barrel are the date and the name Hans Reichsperger, which is the name of either the artist or the owner.",5300.0,"Artist

"Panel, Early/mid–20th century, Kuba","According to oral tradition, the 17th-century Kuba king Shyaam introduced plush-textured raffia textiles to his kingdom. Raffia panels have long been considered valuable in Central Africa. Plain panels were used as currency as early as the 16th century. Until the early 20th century, such panels were exchanged in a variety of contexts—for instance, as royal tribute or part of a marriage contract. Today they continue to be collected by families, used in funeral displays, and buried with important adults.",5308.0,"Culture

"Panel, Early/mid–20th century, Kuba","Across the Kuba kingdon in Central Africa, raffia palm fiber has long been used to weave textiles for clothing, display, and exchange. Produced on a single heddle loom, these small elaborate panels were woven with lengths of raffia peeled from the palm frond and then embellished with geometric patterns. Into the early 20th century, such highly valued panels were frequently displayed at court ceremonies and funerals. Often referred to as ""prestige panels,"" they also functioned as indicator of social status. These panels were also collected by European artists and designers in the early 20th century, with important consequences to the development of European abstraction.",5308.0,"Culture

"Civil War, 1871/73, Édouard Manet","Édouard Manet drew on his painting The Dead Toreador (1864; National Gallery of Art) for this print, transforming its context from a morbid twist on a festive Spanish tauromaquia to the crisis in France’s short-lived Second Empire (1852–70). The tumultuous years 1870–71 marked the humiliating defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian war, the rise and suppression of the revolutionary Paris Commune, and the dawn of the Third Republic. In this print, an unidentified soldier lies behind a Parisian street barricade. A glimpse of a pin-striped civilian pant leg at the lower right hints at the encroachment of violence on everyday life.",5312.0,"Artist

"The Vision of Saint Francis, 1581, Federico Barocci","In this dramatic etching, Saint Francis of Assisi kneels in an ecstatic trance, with his palms outstretched toward the vibrant holy host he envisions above him. This print reproduces the painted altarpiece that Federico Barocci completed in 1576 for the church of San Francesco, Urbino. The setting of the chapel in which the altarpiece still hangs is included in this composition. The print, though technically reproductive, transcends didactic repetition through the graphic zeal of Barocci’s etched line.",5327.0,"Artist

"One Dollar Silver Certificate, 1898/1900, Victor Dubreuil","Having worked as a bank clerk in Paris, Victor Dubreuil moved to the United States in 1882, possibly to escape charges that he had stolen money from his employer. In New York he established himself as an artist, specializing in ultra-illusionistic depictions of currency: some elaborate in composition while others more restrained, such as One Dollar Silver Certificate. In the late 19th century, counterfeiting of legal tender was a widespread problem. Trompe l’oeil replications—albeit on canvas or board rather than paper—aroused suspicion among government officials. At least two of Dubreuil’s paintings on public view were confiscated by the Secret Service in the 1890s.",5331.0,"Artist

"Saint Paul’s, with Other Buildings, 1911, John Marin","Here Marin used a rich purple wash for the ornate spire of Trinity Church. He flattened and compressed the spaces between the structure and the tall buildings visible behind it, including the domed New York World Building on Park Row. He exploited the rough surface of the paper with his soft pencil, keeping his touch light, and after painting with watercolor, he added further marks in graphite for detail. The broken pencil lines and the rounded shapes created by Marin’s brushwork convey kinetic energy and vibrancy.",5335.0,"Artist
