"“Belmead” Center table, c. 1846, Alexander Roux","In 1845 Alexander Jackson Davis designed Belmead, a magnificent Gothic Revival villa, for the prominent builder Philip St. George Cocke of Powhatan County, Virginia. In addition to designing Belmead’s exterior, Davis also designed furniture for the interior, notably a parlor set that included the side chairs (1998.565.1-2). The table descended in the Cocke family along with the parlor set and, remarkably, retains its original marble top and intricately carved tracery lantern. Fitted between the supporting columns, the tracery was installed before the cabinetmaker assembled the table.",5355.0,"Artist

"Fort Peck Dam, Montana, 1936, Margaret Bourke-White","For the inaugural issue of Life magazine, Margaret Bourke-White was assigned to photograph the succession of dams along the Columbia River basin initiated by the Public Works Administration. She recalled being instructed by the publication’s owner, Henry Luce, “to watch out for something on a grand scale that might make a cover.” The image of Fort Peck Dam’s spillway showcases advancements in modern hydropower technology while also treating the concrete structures as stately, ancient monuments. This first cover of Life set the visual tone for the magazine and simultaneously launched Bourke-White into a pathbreaking career in photojournalism; she later became the first female war correspondent and the first female photographer to fly on a combat mission. This print was acquired by the Art Institute one year after Bourke-White held a solo exhibition at the museum.",5356.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Jeanbon Saint-André, 1795, Jacques Louis David","This penetrating character study of the artist’s friend and fellow French revolutionary, Jeanbon Saint-André (1749–1813), made while both were in prison, brilliantly captures the sitter’s political and moral beliefs through his intense and unflinching stare, defiantly crossed arms, and sober black frock coat and hat. At the same time, it recalls profile portraits on ancient coins, thus equating Saint-André and the revolution with the lofty ideals of the Roman republic. David’s handwritten inscription on the drawing reads: “A gift of friendship. Solace of affection. David made this in confinement in the third year of the French Revolution on July 28, 1795.”",5362.0,"Artist

"1915, 1915, Albin Egger-Lienz","In this four-color lithograph, sculpted and depersonalized machinelike bodies charge forward with unfettered vigor. The blunt, angular rendering of their hands make their flesh appear solid and inviolable, while their collective formation mimics the force and symmetry of an engine. The effacement of these soldiers’ features renders their faces impenetrable and their assault terrifying. Here, even while not depicting the actual mechanisms of modern warfare, Albin Egger-Lienz poignantly evoked the brutal dehumanization of the first industrialized war in history.",5365.0,"Artist

"Altar Head for a Chief, 19th/early 20th century, Edo","After death the obas (kings) of Benin are honored with altars that include stylized commemorative heads made of cast-copper alloy. This material has long been highly valued in Benin and until the early 20th century, it could only be used with permission of the oba. Important commoners have wood heads placed on their altars that are fashioned in a similar style to the royal commemorative heads. This wood head is embellished with decorative copper-alloy sheeting and would likely have been made for a high-ranking titleholder or chief loyal to the oba. There is a narrow cavity in the back designed to hold a wooden rod decorated with cowrie shells in imitation of the tall ivory tusks that rise from the commemorative heads of obas. The band of copper, pounded to appear as separate rows, likewise imitates the decorative bands encircling the oba commemorative heads, which reference the coral beads worn by actual obas as a symbol of divine leadership. The top of this head is crowned by a helmet patterned with alternating lines within a grid and a vertically projecting element on the left side. The figure’s face is relatively long and narrow, with full eyes and heavy lids, a wide nose and two parallel rows indicating a mouth.",5370.0,"Culture

"Amsterdam Skyline Viewed from the West, c. 1899, Piet Mondrian","It is difficult to know precisely when Mondrian made this lyrical landscape. Even after he began to create his better-known abstract work, he still made more salable scenes in order to support himself. Since it bears stylistic similarities to his late-19th-century work, the watercolor probably predates 1900. The Amsterdam skyline appears from the west, as it does often in his pictures from that time. Although the scene is filled with lifelike details, Mondrian seemed to have delighted in the rhythmic placement of the trees. As they reach to the upper edge of the sheet, their reflections extend across the water, punctuated intermittently by coppiced stumps.",5372.0,"Artist

"Saint John the Baptist, c. 1505, Giulio Campagnola","Active in Venice, where he learned to generate the diffuse, smoky effects characteristic of his teacher Giorgione, the painter and printmaker Giulio Campagnola is best remembered for his engraving. The artist invented the stipple engraving technique seen here, which was especially popular for reproductions in the 18th and 19th centuries, and he produced this work almost entirely out of dots and flecks. Silhouetting the hard-edged figure of John against a stark white background, Campagnola also relied on a drawing by Andrea Mantegna to give the prophet a powerful presence.",5375.0,"Artist

"France Lighting the World, 1865, Jean Baptiste Carpeaux","In 1863 Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux received a major commission for the pedimental sculpture on the south side of the Pavillon de Flore at the Musée du Louvre, Paris. For this monumental work, he designed three allegorical figures of France seated on an imperial eagle (a reference to the Emperor Napoleon III), flanked by semi-recumbent nude males representing science and agriculture. These plasters demonstrate Carpeaux’s initial conception as it was presented to the commissioning architect; they also reflect his close study of the sculpture of Michelangelo.",5378.0,"Artist

"Study Head of a Bearded Man, c. 1565, Frans Floris, I","Directing large workshop that produced religious and mythological paintings in Antwerp, Frans Floris pioneered the use of head studies like this one to work out expression and movement for complex figural compositions. Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt, and other painters of historical subjects in the 17th century continued this practice. Whereas large finished works from Floris’s shop probably involved the participation of assistants, head studies were executed by the master himself.

In their costumes and facial features, these performers resemble figures depicted in ancient Hellenistic art. The clarity of their features is partially obscured by a thickly applied glaze, as well as by the dense background of undulating foliage, floral heads, and grapevines. Some of these designs clearly derive from Central Asian metalwork.
