"Lobed Bowl with Seated Figure and Attendants, Seljuq dynasty (1037–1194), late 12th/early 13th century, Islamic","Iranian 12th- and 13th-century overglaze-painted ceramics, or mina’i (meaning enameled), are particularly opulent and luxurious objects due to their broad color palette. Prior to the late 12th century, colors applied to ceramics were generally limited to one or two per vessel. This example, however, has a much wider range of color, including red, blue, purple, black, and beige. The use of multiple colors applied over the glazed allowed for the depiction of increasingly complex scenes on ceramic vessels. Note the variety of figural decoration on the bowl, which is derived from stock imagery dealing with courtly culture.",5401.0,"Culture

"Discussion in Art, San Francisco, 1936, Ansel Adams","Ansel Adams was internationally known for his majestic depictions of the American West, made with a clarity and sharpness that embraced the photographic spectrum from darkest black to brightest white. Calling Adams “the one unshakable center in photography,” Hugh Edwards greatly admired his work and acquired nearly 60 of his photographs for the museum. This much more intimate image implies parallels between photography and painting, as the men in a passionate “discussion in art” mirror the forms of the Renaissance painting behind them. This print was a gift to the museum from Katherine Kuh—who had given Adams a one-man show at her Chicago gallery before becoming a curator at the Art Institute—the year that Edwards was named curator of photography.",5415.0,"Artist

"Barn in Blue Haze, 1979, Wolf Kahn","The barn represented in this drawing is repeatedly used by Wolf Kahn to study the interaction of color, light, and form. Like many of his contemporaries, Kahn worked en plein air, examining the structure from different angles, scales, and times of day to discover its varied meanings, much like Claude Monet did in his famous images of haystacks. When this drawing is viewed with other depictions of the barn, it is possible not only to reconstruct the building in the round, but also to understand Kahn’s perceptions of his surroundings and the different methods he used to explore them.",5420.0,"Artist

"Battle of the Naked Men, 1517, Domenico Campagnola","In this battle scene, the landscape is just as important as the context. Deep shading created by the harsh, crosshatched lines reiterates the tumult of the battle. The sketchy engraving style of Domenico Campagnola underlines the vigorous and impulsive nature of his figures. Body proportions are distorted in order to connote pain. Even the barking dog at the lower left has an inaccurately elongated torso, a statement about the distress nature experiences during human conflict. This engraving is one of the artist’s largest.",5421.0,"Artist

"Reclining Female Nude, 1658, Rembrandt van Rijn","Scholars have widely debated Rembrandt’s choice of either a light- or dark-skinned model for this magnificently ambiguous etching. In the 18th century, its given title changed to variations of Reclining Negress. Rembrandt did portray an African model around 1630, but it is unclear if this much-later print represented another. The stark contrast between the cavernous darkness and the bright bed linens suggests the artist’s keen interest in depicting the play of light on skin. Rembrandt’s characteristic use of a Japanese paper support further enhances the heat of the very real and very warm, naked body.",5426.0,"Artist

In Han mythology, such beings are described as immortals (xian). Having achieved eternal life, these immortals were endowed with the power to fly and roamed freely about the universe. The depiction of these remarkable beings in tombs reflects a widespread belief that the soul of the deceased could leave its earth-bound existence, ascend to heaven, and become an immortal. The ascent of the soul to the realm of the immortals is a major theme in Han art.",5433.0,"Title

"Hair Comb, Early 20th century","Among the earliest African objects acquired by the Art Institute was a set of combs, purchased in 1924 for its Children’s Museum. Though upon arrival the combs were registered simply as “African,” stylistic analysis suggests that they probably came from the Belgian Congo, the present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo. Made of thin wooden slats beautifully bound together with decorative lashings, they were among the Art Institute’s first African pieces.",5435.0,"Title
