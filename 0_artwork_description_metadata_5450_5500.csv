"Beach at Low Tide (Mouth of the River), 1869, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","Edgar Degas visited the coast of Normandy in the autumn of 1869 and was inspired to create over 40 small-scale landscape pastels. This particular sheet is one of the very best of this group: clearly articulated and unusual in being signed and dated, it is the only seascape that Degas relinquished during his lifetime.",5451.0,"Artist

"Tureen and Stand, 1773/74, François-Thomas Germain","Jean-François Dapcher, whose maker’s mark is on this early Neoclassical tureen, was a pupil of the great Parisian silversmith and goldsmith François-Thomas Germain (1726–1791). At the time the tureen was produced, Germain was on the run for bankruptcy, and forbidden by law from making or marking silver. This may have obliged him to leave his masterworks unsigned and opt for cover by his apprentice, Dapcher.",5466.0,"Artist

"Tureen and Stand, 1773/74, François-Thomas Germain","The Stroganov coat of arms, emblem of one of the grandest Russian noble families, is prominently featured on both sides of the tureen in an oval shield. The tureen was produced for Count Alexander Sergeyevitch Stroganov, Russian ambassador to London and Naples and a renowned collector and patron of the arts. Like most Russian nobles, Count Alexander loved French culture and commissioned luxurious objects from Parisian craftsmen. Only one other piece from this dinner service is known to have survived. Beef Stroganoff must have been named for a later member of the family as the recipe first appears in a cookbook only in 1861.",5466.0,"Artist

"Rysdyk’s Hambletonian, after 1876, Artist unknown","Hambletonian (1846–1876) was one of the most famous trotters in American racing history. His fame endures today, as he is the progenitor of many current harness-racing horses. Here the horse is posed with his owner, William M. Rysdyk (1809–1870) in his stable in Chester, Orange County, New York. Rysdyk was a hard-working farmhand who saved enough money to buy a mare and colt from his employer in 1849. The bay colt proved to be very fast, and soon demand grew for Hambletonian’s stud services. Supposedly, crowds traveled hundreds of miles for a glimpse of the horse through a narrow, gated window in his stall, which was fiercely guarded by the eccentric and suspicious Rysdyk. The horse’s fame led to a series of portraits with him with his owner. This picture was probably painted from an engraving published in 1876, just a few days after Hambletonian’s death.",5468.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Jean-Joseph Cassanéa de Mondonville, 1746/47, Maurice Quentin de Latour","This virtuoso violinist and composer (1711-1772) was second in command at the royal chapel and director of the Orchestra of the Spiritual Concert, both important musical institutions in eighteenth century Paris, and was as renowned for his theater pieces as he was for his motets. La Tour was a close friend, and a newly elected member of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, when he captured this informal but sympathetic pose of de Mondonville tuning his violin. It was shown in the Salon of 1747.",5485.0,"Artist

"Spring (Montbarbin), 1909, John Marin","Shown at Stieglitz’s New York gallery in 1910, this delicate yet energetic work is one of several landscapes that Marin painted in the Seine-et-Marne region east of Paris. Set among lush rolling meadows, the distant village of Montbarbin was rendered by staining wet paper with pale washes of green-gray and pink. The artist used stronger washes to suggest the contours of rocks and boulders in the foreground, and rapid brushstrokes to indicate the movement of air and clouds. Marin completed this watercolor by dabbing shapes in a darker gray wash on the left with a crumpled rag, approximating the fluttering leaves of a small tree. These untethered blots seem to be borne aloft by the energy of buffeting breezes.",5495.0,"Artist

"Actresses in Their Dressing Rooms, 1879–80, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","The intimate dramas playing out in this gallery draw their emotional power from the vulnerability of the exposed human form. Featured in these voyeuristic prints and drawings are private scenes of tragedy, tenderness, and horror, as artists intruded upon such previously forbidden settings as the bedroom, the deathbed, and the crime scene. While Félix Vallotton’s Intimacy woodcuts address the theme of undressing, with John Sloan’s playful Turning Out the Light and Gustav Klimt’s Seated Woman verging into the erotic, other images depict serious illnesses and the deaths of family members, especially children, which were commonplace events throughout the 19th century.",5497.0,"Artist

"Actresses in Their Dressing Rooms, 1879–80, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","Making an explicit connection between sex and death is Otto Dix’s Murder, which pairs a bloody corpse with two dogs in the act of copulation. The Northern European artists Käthe Kollwitz and Edvard Munch drew on personal experiences for their devastating images of loss, seen here in stark scenes of grief. Kollwitz and the caricaturist Honoré Daumier (in an unusually somber mood) used similar iconographies of partially exposed corpses to make political statements: Daumier criticized the contemporary French government’s excessive response to a lower class riot in his Rue Transnonian, while Kollwitz drew on her own socialist sympathies in evoking war horrors in Raped, part of her series about the disastrous 1525 German Peasants’ War. The scattered feet of the family members in Daumier’s Transnonian and the nearly invisible child’s head to the left of Kollwitz’s splayed female body remind the viewer of these scenes’ universal themes.",5497.0,"Artist
