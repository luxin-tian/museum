"Christ Crowned with Thorns, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",5508.0,"Artist

"Winston Man, c. 1980, Andy Warhol","Andy Warhol used his art to comment upon the ubiquity of large-than-life celebrities and iconic American brands. Throughout his career Warhol took tens of thousands of photographs with instant (Polaroid) cameras or point-and-shoot 35mm cameras, which became his preferred way to collect snippets of everyday encounters. From 1976 until his death in 1987, he enlisted his assistants to stitch together identical black-and-white photographs—grouped in grids of four, six, or twelve—with a sewing machine. In his silkscreen canvases of the 1960s, Warhol had employed repetition (for example, reproducing a glamour shot of Marilyn Monroe 25 times) yet he had made nearly every image slightly different, accentuating the “mistakes” of slippage, streaking, and blurring that are inherent to the silkscreen process. In these later stitched composites, by contrast, Warhol opted for an utterly impersonal sameness, perhaps to stress that the photograph—whether of an iconic subject or of something more banal—is an infinitely circulating image.",5514.0,"Artist

"A.I.Z. (Workers’ Illustrated Magazine), 1929–34, John Heartfield","In 1929, following ten years of activity in photomontage and publishing, John Heartfield began working for the left-wing periodical Workers’ Illustrated Magazine (Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung [AIZ]). The weekly magazine, founded to popularize news and images from a working-class viewpoint, served from the first as a major organ of opposition to the rising National Socialist Party. When Hitler took power in early 1933, Heartfield and the AIZ editorial office fled to Prague; many of Heartfield’s best-known covers for the magazine were made in the Czech capital. Among them is this iconic picture of a monumental fist that contains a multitude of arms raised in solidarity. The composition, exceptional for Heartfield in that it shows a picture of inspiration rather than acerbic critique, was undoubtedly influenced by the work of Soviet photomontage artist Gustav Klutsis, particularly a 1932 election poster for which Klutsis repeated the image of his own raised palm numerous times to evoke a crowd acting as one. In 2009 the Art Institute acquired a premier collection of Central and Eastern European photography in print that includes 163 issues of AIZ—one of the largest such holdings in the United States—and many other books, periodicals, and posters by both Heartfield and Klutsis.",5516.0,"Artist

"The Fall of Phaeton, after 1776, Antonio Tempesta","Phaeton’s overweening ambition to guide his father’s chariot of the sun through the sky is recorded in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, as is the disastrous outcome of his attempt, here presented in a dramatic scene that captures the tumultuous moment of Phaeton’s being struck down by a thunderbolt from Zeus. The scalloped valance and matching side curtains that frame the scene link it to The Arrival of Telemachus on Calypso’s Island. The two tapestries are part of a Story of Telemachus suite based on François Fénelon’s Adventures of Telemachus (Les Aventures de Télémaque; 1699), which was originally written as an ethical guide for the education of Louis, Duke of Burgundy (1618–1712), the grandson and heir of Louis XIV (r. 1643–1715). Phaeton’s story—particularly his death, as depicted in this tapestry—conveys the consequences of youthful intrepidity and pride, and like the tapestries’ source material, offers viewers a powerful moral lesson.",5525.0,"Artist

"Hagar and Ishmael, 1856, Edward Sheffield Bartholomew","During his brief career, Edward Sheffield Bartholomew was recognized by both critics and patrons for his sensitive marble renderings of biblical and mythological scenes. Taken from the book of Genesis, the story of the Egyptian handmaiden Hagar and her son, Ishmael, is one of deception and family betrayal. After giving birth to Ishmael, the illegitimate son of Abram (later Abraham), Hagar and her son are banished from the house of Abraham. Expelled to the desert, they are rescued from certain death by God, who provides a well to quench their thirst. Bartholomew’s relief shows the moment when Hagar pleads to the heavens to rescue her son. In the 19th century the story of Hagar was understood as an allegory of slavery that illustrated the indignities suffered by black women as well as the disenfranchisement of all African Americans.",5527.0,"Artist

"Portière, 1901, George Washington Maher","Chicago architect George W.

"Untitled (Satie and Ravel), March 14, 1968–early September 1969, Joseph Cornell","Cornell used photosets of a 1927 drawing by his beloved brother Robert in this and several other collages. Here he combined it with a reproduction of a note by Satie about Ravel who, Satie wrote, “assures me every time that I meet him, that he owes me a lot.” Robert, who suffered from a form of cerebral palsy, had died in 1965 at the age of fifty-four. A memorial exhibition of drawings by Robert and collages by Joseph had been held at Robert Schoelkopfs New York gallery in 1966. There is no reason to doubt the dates noted on the frame of the collage: Cornell refers on many occasions during this period to his brother Robert’s drawing of a rabbit, and also to Satie and Ravel. In February and March, when this collage was presumably begun, Cornell described its powerful emotional associations, linking it to music: “what seemed elusive, lost earlier—the way that Robert’s drawing … brought about this lovely business—bringing to life, bringing together Chabrier, S. Saens, Mme Manet (and by implication, Debussy) via the original drawing” (Cornell 1993, p. 390; entry for Feb. 23, 1968); in March he mentioned again “Carolyn‘s ‘Ravel Rabbit‘ par excellence Robert’s ‘Rabbit’” (Cornell 1993, p. 391; entry for March 10, 1968).",5541.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Satie and Ravel), March 14, 1968–early September 1969, Joseph Cornell","Ravel was much in Cornell‘s mind at the time, perhaps partly because of an anecdote he mentioned in his diary: after the death of his mother, Ravel never returned to the apartment they had shared at 4, avenue Carnot. Cornell’s mother had died a year after Robert, in 1966, and his diary reveals how painful this double loss was. He addressed notes to his mother and on occasion heard Robert’s voice in the house. But he had by no means lost his avid curiosity and continued to work. Cornell had often worked listening to music—an important element in the complex associations he sought to instill in his boxes and collages. He became more reflective about his own working procedures toward the end of his life, commenting on the working procedures of artists and musicians he admired: “A musing: Erik Satie’s ‘hysterical’ obsessions with putting things to music. Ravel anecdote about Satie even wanting to put a menu to music” (Cornell 1993, p. 416).",5541.0,"Artist

It is the same animal which one also finds, however, with its wings spread, in the lower part of the Borghese coat-of-arms.
