"The Key, 1946, Jackson Pollock","The Key belongs to Jackson Pollock’s Accabonac Creek series, named for a stream near the East Hampton property that he and his wife, the painter Lee Krasner, purchased in late 1945. Marking a crucial moment in his evolution as an artist, this quasi-Surrealist painting was created on the floor of an upstairs bedroom and worked on directly from all sides. Although there is a general suggestion of landscape, here the process of painting became primary, expressing the power of spontaneous action and chance effects. The resulting abstraction, with its expressive, gestural appearance, prefigured the allover compositions of Pollock’s celebrated drip paintings, which debuted the following year.",552.0,"Artist

"Yellow Hickory Leaves with Daisy, 1928, Georgia O’Keeffe","In the 1920s, Georgia O’Keeffe began concentrating on representing enlarged still-life elements with carefully realistic handling. Although known more for her flower paintings, she frequently depicted leaves, inspired by the examples she found on her walks around Lake George in upstate New York, where she summered with her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, between 1918 and 1928. In Yellow Hickory Leaves with Daisy, O’Keeffe painted the leaves around the small white daisy at lower center so that they seem to be emanating from the flower. She hoped that the strangely magnified subjects would inspire viewers to, as she said, “be surprised into taking time to look at” them in a new way.",553.0,"Artist

"Mahana no atua (Day of the God), 1894, Paul Gauguin","Day of the God is one of a small number of paintings of Tahitian subjects that Paul Gauguin made in France between his stays in the South Pacific. An imaginary rather than realistic depiction of the South Seas, it is dominated by an idol of the goddess Hina. To the right of her, women dance the upaupa, a suggestive ancient Tahitian dance that missionaries and colonial authorities tried to suppress. In a middle ground of pink sand sits a female bather flanked by ambiguously gendered figures lying on their sides. Although the arrangement of this trio seems symbolic—perhaps of birth, life, and death—Gauguin made its exact meaning an enigma.",561.0,"Artist

"Thanksgiving, c. 1935, Doris Lee","Doris Lee’s bustling scene of women preparing a Thanksgiving feast became the object of national headlines when it was first exhibited at the Art Institute in 1935 and won the prestigious Logan Purchase Prize. The themes of Thanksgiving, rural customs, and family life, which Lee painted in a deliberately folksy manner, would have had great appeal to a country still in the midst of the Depression. Yet Josephine Logan, the donor of the prize, condemned the work’s broad, exaggerated style, founding the conservative “Sanity in Art” movement in response. This controversy only brought Lee fame, and Thanksgiving has been recognized as one of the most popular nostalgic views of this American ritual since that time.",562.0,"Artist

"Statue of the Aphrodite of Knidos, 2nd century AD, Praxiteles","This statue was inspired by the most famous Greek sculpture of a goddess, the Aphrodite of Knidos. Carved by the sculptor Praxiteles in the 4th century B.C. from fine marble, it enjoyed great renown as the first devotional statue of a female goddess in the nude. It produced an immediate sensation when it was installed in a sacred precinct on the island of Knidos, and, centuries later, it inspired Roman artists to re-create the celebrated image of the goddess. Although the earlier Greek sculpture no longer exists, Roman statues such as this inform us of its likely appearance. However, the function of these later Roman versions was fundamentally different from that of the earlier Greek work: what had once been an object of veneration among the Greeks became a favorite garden ornament for wealthy Romans. Adapted for such a use, the badly marred surface of the statue is the result of prolonged exposure to the elements.",564.0,"Artist

"The Golden Wall, 1961, Hans Hofmann","After studying in Paris among early Fauve and Cubist artists, and having an influential teaching career in Germany and the United States, Hans Hofmann began to devote himself exclusively to his own painting in 1958. Frustrated by the limits of linear perspective, he introduced his “push-and-pull” theory in order to create a more dynamic sense of space in his paintings, in which forms and colors appear to simultaneously advance and recede. In The Golden Wall, rectangles of varying sizes and colors direct the gaze across the picture. Some forms appear to float above the expressive brushstrokes that punctuate the work, while others are embedded in the background, providing the canvas with a lively sense of movement and dimension.",582.0,"Artist

"Oinochoe (Pitcher), 550/500 BC, Ancient Etruscan","This pitcher for wine is called an oinochoe, a combination of the Greek oînos, ""wine"" and khéō, ""I pour"". The shiny black glaze is the result of a technique invented by the Etruscans, a powerful ancient civilization in ancient Italy - near modern day Tuscany - with whom the Greeks regularly traded. The glossy black pottery later known as Bucchero ware was made from the 7th century to the late 5th century BC. Produced for both domestic and funerary uses, Bucchero ware was popular locally and across the Mediterranean. Potters achieved the signature shiny black surface by firing the pottery in a reduced-oxygen kiln, where restricted ventilation caused the iron oxide in the coarse Tuscan clay to turn black. Before firing, the clay was burnished, or polished with a smooth stone, resulting in the sought-after sheen, which mimicked the gleam of bronze vessels.",583.0,"Culture

"A Mother Feeding her Child (The Happy Mother), 1707, Willem van Mieris","Willem van Mieris employed the refined, enamel-like painting technique associated with the artists of Leiden, achieving a surface that shows no obvious traces of the brush. His father, Frans van Mieris, was also a leading practitioner of this manner. Whereas Frans’s subjects were often satirical, Willem responded to the fashion for more dignified, classicizing subjects that emerged in the last decades of the 17th century. In this traditional domestic interior, Willem treated the middle-class mother and her children as rather elegant, generalized types. Paintings by the Van Mieris family and other examples of Leiden “fine painting” were much sought after by 18th century collectors.",590.0,"Artist

"The Resurrection, 1619/20, Francesco Buoneri","The Resurrection, the only documented painting by Francesco Buoneri, was commissioned in 1619 by the Tuscan ambassador to Rome, Piero Guicciardini, as one of several altarpieces for his family’s chapel in Florence. In a turn of events that was not uncommon in the rapidly evolving artistic scene of early-17th-century Rome, the painting was rejected by Guicciardini and sold to another collector. The Resurrection exaggerates the bold contrast of light and dark and the realistic treatment of sacred figures that Caravaggio had introduced into Roman painting. Buoneri was apparently one of Caravaggio’s closest followers. He may have been the ""boy Francesco"" who assisted the painter during his last years in Rome, a personal connection suggested by his contemporary nickname, Cecco (for Francesco) del Caravaggio.",591.0,"Artist

"The Drinkers, 1890, Vincent van Gogh","During his time in the Asylum of Saint-Paul in Saint-Rémy, a small town near Arles, Vincent van Gogh made a number of copies of the work of artists he admired, which freed him from having to produce original compositions and allowed him to concentrate instead on interpretation. For this image, Van Gogh copied a wood engraving from Honoré Daumier’s Drinkers, a parody on the four ages of man. The exaggerated figure types capture Daumier’s characteristic humor and convey his sad message about the horrors of alcoholism. The greenish palette may well be an allusion to the notorious alcoholic drink absinthe.",595.0,"Artist

The actor stands alone in theatrical lighting, with the diagonals of the rapier and shadows on the floor suggesting his violent state of mind. Rouvière is thought to have based his intense and physically exaggerated portrayal of Hamlet on Delacroix’s series of lithographs, two of which are on display nearby. Manet painted a nearly identical portrait of Rouvière as Hamlet in 1865, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

Van Gogh had seen works by Signac and Georges Seurat in the spring of 1886 at the final Impressionist exhibition. Signac was an eloquent spokesman for Seurat’s pioneering Neo-Impressionism, explaining it as a natural development of Impressionism. Under Signac’s influence, Van Gogh’s palette brightened, his brushstrokes became more varied, and his subject matter expanded. The setting of this work is the Seine River at the Pont de Clichy, near Asnières, where Van Gogh and Signac painted together on several occasions.",598.0,"Artist
