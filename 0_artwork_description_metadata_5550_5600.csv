"The Crucifixion, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",5551.0,"Artist

"Olivia Simes Morris, 1814, James Peale","James Peale was a member of a prominent Philadelphia family of artists, brother of Charles Willson Peale and father of several accomplished female painters. Olivia Simes Morris was also a member of the city’s cultural elite, her husband having been a cofounder of the Columbianum, a short-lived artists’ association that Charles Willson Peale organized. Olivia Simes Morris is a sensitive portrayal of the sitter. Embellishments of lace and a richly colored embroidered shawl add notes of refinement to an otherwise restrained composition. James Peale practiced portraiture throughout his long career. In addition to oil portraits, he excelled at miniatures, delicate likenesses of watercolor on ivory.",5557.0,"Artist

"Fish and Plants, 1908, Ikeda Keisen","The artist Ikeda Keisen, as he recorded in his signature, modeled this work on the small-scale sketches of his father, making it clear that the execution of these screens was a deeply personal exercise. His father was a famous painter of the Nanga school, which flourished in Japan in the 18th and 19th centuries and took its subject matter and technique from Chinese literati paintings and printed books. This screen is a celebration of this venerated painting tradition, although Ikeda Keisen’s work is anything but traditional.",5558.0,"Artist

"1992 World’s Fair, Chicago, Illinois: Pespective Rendering of Ferris Wheel, Looking West through Navy Pier Atrium, 1977, Harry Weese","Unfortunately for Weese, the vision of the Chicago World’s Fair-1992 Corporation differed greatly from his. They desired a central site dominating Burnham Harbor, while Weese had envisioned an extended lakefront site from Navy Pier to Meigs Field, connected by a Skyride. Weese later lobbied for this site, but to no avail. Ironically, it was the Fair Corporation’s (and later the Fair Authority’s) unbending insistence that the fair be built in their vision that would ultimately lead to the Fair’s demise in 1985. The budding plans for the fair called for two cities hosting simultaneously: Chicago and Seville, Spain. After Chicago was eliminated, Seville became—and remained—the sole host.",5564.0,"Artist

"Backgammon Players, c. 1630, Lucas Emil Vorsterman","Adam de Coster was a prominent painter of illuminated night scenes in Antwerp around 1630, about the same time that Lucas Emil Vorsterman was engraving works after his popular contemporaries in the same city. A student of Peter Paul Rubens, Vorsterman employed a style that was originally similar to that of the Flemish master, until a falling out with Rubens and subsequent trip to England provoked him to create stronger, more stylized, Caravaggesque engravings such as Backgammon Players. Clearly influenced by De Coster’s handling of light, Vorsterman brightened the otherwise dark scene with two candles whose flames illuminate the faces of those seated around the table.",5570.0,"Artist

The Hellenistic period spans the nearly three hundred years between the death of Alexander the Great of
Macedonia (323 B.C.) and that of Cleopatra VII of Egypt (30 B.C.), a descendant of one of Alexander’s generals. The term Hellenistic is derived from Hellas, an ancient Greek word for Greece. It is used to describe both chronologically and culturally the era following Alexander’s conquest of Egypt and Asia, which resulted in the spread of Greek culture across a vast area. The melding of local and Greek artistic styles with the luxurious materials captured in the conquered lands resulted in magnificent artwork, including elegant coinage.",5578.0,"Culture

By the time he died at the age of 33, he had carefully crafted a reputation that made him seem larger than life, even heroic. In part he accomplished this by claiming that he was a descendant of the great Greek hero Herakles (for more about Herakles, see the entry on this coin in LaunchPad). Here he wears the skin of the Nemean lion, which Herakles killed during the first of his fabled Twelve Labors. Yet the face is Alexander’s, with its distinctively upswept hair and upwardly gazing eyes. Following Alexander’s death, his generals adopted his pose and style on their coinage, and this practice continued for the next two hundred years.",5578.0,"Culture

A painting and print by Delacroix, from 1830 and 1831, respectively, may have inspired the feline family grouping seen here. Barye and Delacroix also spent time drawing animals from life at the Jardin des Plantes. Access to sketch the zoo animals was not guaranteed unless, like Barye and Delacroix, one knew the director; the fascinated public applied in droves for tickets when a giraffe entered the menagerie in 1827.",5585.0,"Artist

"Wild Horse, or Frightened Horse Leaving the Water, 1828, Eugène Delacroix","One of Delacroix’s early lithographs, this image has become an icon of French romanticism. Theodore Géricault, Baron Gros, and even earlier, Jacques Louis David, had depicted the horse as a noble and trustworthy creature, but, for Delacroix, the horse epitomized a wilder spirit. In this brilliant impression, the primal fear of a threatened wild beast is expressed with particular drama. Here we see the quintessential Delacroix, who, as the poet Charles Baudelaire wrote, ""was passionately in love with passion and coldly determined to seek the means of expressing it.”",5587.0,"Artist
