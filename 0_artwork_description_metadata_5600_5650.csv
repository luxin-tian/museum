"Clock, 1928/29, Paul Theodore Frankl","In addition to skyscraper-inspired furniture such as the Art Institute’s tall, stepped cabinet (see 1998.567), Paul Frankl designed small objects intended to be strategically placed throughout the home in order to create unified, modern interiors. This electric clock was heralded as thoroughly modern, both inside and out. Not only was it featured as an exemplary modern decorative object in contemporary publications, it was also advertised as affordable and “nontarnishable” in order to appeal to a wide consumer base.",5604.0,"Artist

"Urizen, 1794, William Blake","Although produced as an independent work, this unique hand-colored print is based on one of Blake’s plates from The Book of Urizen (published 1794), among the artist’s most complex printed books. In it, Blake’s invented mythology describes Urizen as “Creator of Men,” a god of immense power who invented a repressive web of laws and religion based on reason. For Blake, Urizen’s laws limited energy and crushed the imagination.
Here, Blake depicts Urizen as a bearded old man crouching beneath a large rock, adhering closely to the following verses from The Book of Urizen: “And a roof, vast petrific around, / On all sides He fram’d: like a womb.”",5605.0,"Artist

"Granary (Cang), Eastern Han dynasty (A.D. 25–220)","As burial practices filtered down from the Han aristocracy to officials and landowners, tomb models related to farming, an honored occupation, became increasingly popular. The granary, used to store millet, barley, and wheat, was depicted either as a jar or as a small building. The two-story granary found in southern Chinese tombs of the Western Han dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 9) was a wood or ceramic model elevated on stilts. By the Eastern Han dynasty, this rectangular structure had spread to northern China and was raised on legs that were formed as crouching bears, a convention common to Han art. The inscription painted on the door of this granary states that it was made for the tomb of a local official.",5606.0,"Title

"Raped, c. 1908, Käthe Kollwitz","The intimate dramas playing out in this gallery draw their emotional power from the vulnerability of the exposed human form. Featured in these voyeuristic prints and drawings are private scenes of tragedy, tenderness, and horror, as artists intruded upon such previously forbidden settings as the bedroom, the deathbed, and the crime scene. While Félix Vallotton’s Intimacy woodcuts address the theme of undressing, with John Sloan’s playful Turning Out the Light and Gustav Klimt’s Seated Woman verging into the erotic, other images depict serious illnesses and the deaths of family members, especially children, which were commonplace events throughout the 19th century.",5614.0,"Artist

"Raped, c. 1908, Käthe Kollwitz","Making an explicit connection between sex and death is Otto Dix’s Murder, which pairs a bloody corpse with two dogs in the act of copulation. The Northern European artists Käthe Kollwitz and Edvard Munch drew on personal experiences for their devastating images of loss, seen here in stark scenes of grief. Kollwitz and the caricaturist Honoré Daumier (in an unusually somber mood) used similar iconographies of partially exposed corpses to make political statements: Daumier criticized the contemporary French government’s excessive response to a lower class riot in his Rue Transnonian, while Kollwitz drew on her own socialist sympathies in evoking war horrors in Raped, part of her series about the disastrous 1525 German Peasants’ War. The scattered feet of the family members in Daumier’s Transnonian and the nearly invisible child’s head to the left of Kollwitz’s splayed female body remind the viewer of these scenes’ universal themes.",5614.0,"Artist

"The Mill Pond, 1913, Gustave Baumann","The Mill Pond is one of Baumann’s most ambitious prints. After exhibiting a group of five-color woodblock prints— including Harden Hollow, on view nearby—at the Art Institute in January 1913, he decided to make a series of larger, six-color woodblocks, intending to have them hung in the classrooms of local schools. This work comes from the latter series. The plan of putting the prints in schools did not come to fruition, however, and Baumann took a brief hiatus from printmaking. His interest in the medium was later revived by his success at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition.",5616.0,"Artist

"Fashions, 1996, Charles Ray","Since the early 1970s, Los Angeles–based artist Charles Ray has produced sculptural works that disorient viewers and command space in unusual ways, exploring its aesthetic and psychological implications. Influenced in part by the simplicity, emotional blankness, and serial quality of Minimalism, Ray chooses subjects that may at first seem simple but, upon closer observation, reveal an ambitious combination of formalism and technical complexity. Viewers experience cognitive dissonance when encountering Ray’s works, which include life-size or larger than life-size mannequins and everyday objects. The artist’s hyperbolic presentation of the real, whether overexaggerated—or, as in Fashions, underexaggerated—turns the ordinary into the hallucinatory.
In this, his only completed film, Ray shows his friend and former student Frances Stark, now a noted artist, modeling one hundred original outfits while rotating slowly on a small platform that he controlled. Standing in contrapposto, Stark attempts to mimic both the stoic pose of a classical statue and the stiffness of a modern commercial mannequin. However, her clearly visible tattoo, uneven tan lines, and blinking eyes signal that she is real. Given Ray’s ongoing quest to at once objectify the living and animate the lifeless, Fashions is unusual in that humanity prevails.
As the title indicates, the focus is on the clothes, which Ray designed and then stapled or taped together. At the end of each rotation of the platform, the film cuts to a new ensemble, with absolutely no other action. As Ray described it, Stark becomes an “armature” on which to build his work, a means “to show off the labor.” Fashion is also used as a metaphor for identity; it can be interpreted differently depending on the beholder, fostering a false intimacy between the subject and viewer.
Fashions combines the ideas appearing in Ray’s previous work with mannequins; his photographic piece All My Clothes (1973); and the sculptural Tabletop (1989), in which a bowl, potted plant, and other objects rotate slowly on a table. According to the artist, Fashions also recalls his sculptural piece Puzzle Bottle (1973), for which he sealed a scaled-down figure of himself in a bottle, forming an abstract space that exists outside of time. A film installation that should be viewed from beginning to end, Fashions is meant to be shown with a whirring, flickering 16mm film projector, a nearly outmoded format reminiscent of the ones used in Ray’s high school. The size, rotational speed, and mechanical movement of the film reel echoes that of Stark’s platform, collapsing the difference between the projector and the image it displays.",5617.0,"Artist

"Library Ladder, 1782, William France","Badminton House in Gloucestershire, England, is perhaps best known as the site where the first game of badminton was played (on a rainy day in 1863), but as the principal country residence of the Dukes of Beaufort its historical importance long predates that event. Several of the dukes enriched the beauty of the house. For example, the 4th Duke commissioned a suite of chinoiserie furniture from the fashionable London cabinet makers John and William Linnell in 1754, which became famous enough to influence future projects. Similarly, the 4th Duke’s son, who became the 5th Duke of Beaufort in 1756 when he was only twelve years old, wasted no time in making additions of his own to Badminton when he reached his majority. In his account books for 1782 appears the following entry: “February 23 to Wm France Library Ladder 16 Pounds 11s.” The reference is to the London cabinetmaker William France, Jr., whose father had set up a significant cabinetmaking shop next door to Thomas Chippendale’s in St. Martin’s Lane in the 1760s.",5632.0,"Artist

"Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers, Late 17th/early 18th century, Sekkei","Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers, which first developed as poetic themes in 11th-century China, later became one of the favorite subjects in Japanese ink painting because it allows for so many aspects of a landscape to be treated in one work. This is especially evident in the pair of folding screens seen here. On the far right is “Autumn Moon over Dongting,” exemplified by the small sphere rising just above the mountains in the distance. At the left edge of the same screen, “Night Rain on the Xiao and Xiang” is given expression as streaks of ink wash through which a lone boat makes its way across the river. The artist’s combination of lively ink brushwork with golden clouds fuses both Chinese and Japanese sensibilities.",5633.0,"Artist
