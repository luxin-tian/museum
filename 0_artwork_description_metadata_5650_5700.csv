"Wine Container, Western Zhou dynasty ( 1046–771 BC ), late 11th century BC","The bulging, curvilinear silhouette of this house-shaped wine container is emphasized by prominent, hooked flanges, which also accent the surface divisions created by sectional mold casting. The elements of surface decoration—high relief monster (taotie) masks, crested and plumed birds, and dragons with reverted heads are extravagantly shaped: Fringes with elaborate hooks and quills, their curves and coils extend and replicate to symmetrically fill the divided panels of the body and lid.",5650.0,"Title

"Kente Wrapper, 1901/50, Asante","Since the early 18th century, kente cloth has been an important part of Asante royal regalia. Known for its bold, contrasting colors and dense patterns, kente has a striking visual impact when worn. Traditionally, Asante men weave kente. They begin by making a long strip, two- to three-inches wide, on a horizontal loom. When finished, the strip is cut into sections of equal length and sewn together edge to edge to make a complete cloth. The heaviest and most elaborate garments may join as many as 24 strips. Though once restricted to royal use, today kente is more accessible to the public. It is often worn on special religious or social occasions, including weddings, child-naming ceremonies, burials, and funerals.",5669.0,"Culture

"Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight, 1769, William Pether","Before Valentine Green and Richard Earlom, William Pether created major mezzotints from several of the 14 paintings Joseph Wright of Derby exhibited in London between 1765 and 1772. Many of these were “candlelight pictures,” a genre exceedingly well suited to mezzotint tones. Yet Pether waited for a successful review of the 1766 painting for A Philosopher Giving a Lecture on the Orrery before he began the laborious mezzotint process, completing it only in 1768. The print sold so well that Valentine Green saw a lucrative opportunity and absconded with the mezzotint commission that could have been Pether’s for Experiment on the Air Pump.",5670.0,"Artist

"Tetradrachm (Coin) Portraying Alexander the Great Wearing the Head of the Nemean Lion as a Helmet, 336/323 BC, Ancient Greek","Herakles was the consummate hero. Temples across Greece and South Italy were dedicated to him, the son of Zeus, and Romans, who knew him as Hercules, celebrated him as a role model. With brute force, determination, and just enough cleverness, Herakles completed his famous Twelve Labors to become immortal. Herakles is readily identifiable by his knobby club and lion’s skin. The latter refers to his First Labor, in which he killed a magical beast who was ravaging the town of Nemea. The lion’s invincible hide made him immune to weapons, so Herakles strangled him and took his pelt.",5677.0,"Culture

"United by Music, Ming dynasty (1368–1644), 15th/16th century, Zhou Wenju","This all-female ensemble is an imperial or aristocratic orchestra. Singly or in pairs, the musicians play the large drum, clapper, oboe, vertical flute, transverse flute, hourglass drum, mouth organ, gong-chime, long zither, angular harp, and lute. Such instruments accurately represent those played by the mid- Tang dynasty (eighth century), as known today from surviving artifacts and textural descriptions of the Imperial Conservatory of Music. The audience for this concert strikingly resembles court figures depicted in The Night Revels of Han Xizai, a painting in the Palace Museum, Beijing, attributed to the tenth century painter Gu Hongzhong. Gu Hongzhong was a contemporary of Zhou Wenju, to whom this handscroll was originally ascribed. The artist responsible for this fifteenth-century painting apparently drew upon a number of earlier artistic models, creating a composite image that recalled the work of past centuries.",5681.0,"Artist

"Turkish Cavalier in Combat, c. 1818, Jean Louis André Théodore Géricault","Soldiers and horses were among Géricault’s favorite subjects, symbolizing energy, emotion, and individuality. In its laser-like focus on one cavalry soldier and his charging horse in the heat of battle, this drawing’s romantic intensity departs radically from the Classical restraint of many works of the period.
Géricault exoticized his horseman, giving him African features and clothing him in the garb of an Ottoman mamluk, a caste of Muslim slave soldiers who fought for their indepe-dence in Egypt in the early 1800s. The artist was politically progressive for his time and championed the cause of liberty with this image. However, mamluks were most often of Turkic, Coptic, or Circassian descent, and Géricault’s depiction may not have been historically accurate.",5684.0,"Artist

Renaissance artists including Sandro Botticelli, Andrea Mantegna, Albrecht Dürer, and even Pieter Brueghel produced drawings and paintings based on the historian Lucian’s descriptions in homage to various artists of antiquity. Dürer was even called “the Apelles of the North.” Cort’s engraving includes an illusionistic heavily sculptured frame, which highlights prints’ ability to mimic paintings as objects, as well as revive their iconography.",5693.0,"Artist

"Red Coat, 1982, Alex Katz","This final preparatory cartoon for the painting Red Coat (1982, Whitney Museum of American Art) illustrates the last step in Alex Katz’s very traditional working process, a method that can be traced back to the Renaissance. Katz begins his portraits with a series of preparatory sketches from life. In these sketches, Katz experiments with gesture and works out ideas for the finished composition. Katz then creates a small painting of the subject, consolidating the ideas he has explored in the previous sketches. A finished drawing in which the artist resolves all of the remaining compositional and lighting issues is made from the painted sketch and enlarged into a cartoon. The cartoon is transferred by poking holes along the lines of the drawing with a pouncing wheel. It is placed on the canvas, and dry pigment is pressed through the holes in the drawing, transferring the lines onto the canvas. Ultimately, because its composition is so carefully plotted out, the work has an intentionally limited sense of spontaneity.",5695.0,"Artist
