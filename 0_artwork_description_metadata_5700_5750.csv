"Pyxis (Container for Personal Objects), 580/570 BC, Ampersand Painter","Located on the narrow isthmus that joins the Greek mainland and the Peloponnese, with natural harbors facing east and west, Corinth was the major port of trade in Greece for most of the Archaic period (700–480BC). Producers exported scented oil around the Mediterranean in terra-cotta containers that survive today in the thousands.",5702.0,"Artist

"Pyxis (Container for Personal Objects), 580/570 BC, Ampersand Painter","Around the time that this jar was made, Egypt’s king, Amasis (r. 570–526 B.C.), in the interest of trade, gave the Greeks the Egyptian port city of Naucratis, where Greek and Egyptian cultures mingled. The small sphinx on this jar is indicative of this cultural encounter, as Greeks would have been familiar with the part human, part-lion creatures, which lined the entryway to most Egyptian temples. Including a sphinx on this jar added a touch of the exotic East, which would have appealed to the citizens of Corinth.",5702.0,"Artist

"Pyxis (Container for Personal Objects), 580/570 BC, Ampersand Painter","The identities of most Greek vase painters are unknown, so sometimes they are named after a distinctive feature. The artist who decorated this container is called the Ampersand Painter because here and elsewhere the looping tail of the sphinx (a winged feline with a human head) takes the shape of an ampersand, the proper name for the symbol &, which is shorthand for the word ""and"".",5702.0,"Artist

"Murder, plate two from Death and Resurrection, 1922, Otto Dix","The intimate dramas playing out in this gallery draw their emotional power from the vulnerability of the exposed human form. Featured in these voyeuristic prints and drawings are private scenes of tragedy, tenderness, and horror, as artists intruded upon such previously forbidden settings as the bedroom, the deathbed, and the crime scene. While Félix Vallotton’s Intimacy woodcuts address the theme of undressing, with John Sloan’s playful Turning Out the Light and Gustav Klimt’s Seated Woman verging into the erotic, other images depict serious illnesses and the deaths of family members, especially children, which were commonplace events throughout the 19th century.",5709.0,"Artist

"Murder, plate two from Death and Resurrection, 1922, Otto Dix","Making an explicit connection between sex and death is Otto Dix’s Murder, which pairs a bloody corpse with two dogs in the act of copulation. The Northern European artists Käthe Kollwitz and Edvard Munch drew on personal experiences for their devastating images of loss, seen here in stark scenes of grief. Kollwitz and the caricaturist Honoré Daumier (in an unusually somber mood) used similar iconographies of partially exposed corpses to make political statements: Daumier criticized the contemporary French government’s excessive response to a lower class riot in his Rue Transnonian, while Kollwitz drew on her own socialist sympathies in evoking war horrors in Raped, part of her series about the disastrous 1525 German Peasants’ War. The scattered feet of the family members in Daumier’s Transnonian and the nearly invisible child’s head to the left of Kollwitz’s splayed female body remind the viewer of these scenes’ universal themes.",5709.0,"Artist

"Deep South, 1998, Sally Mann","Sally Mann has documented her native Virginia for more than 30 years. In her series Deep South, she metaphorically transposes histories of the American South into photographs using the wet-plate collodion process. The laborious technique, which dates to the Civil War, requires the photographer to bring a bulky view camera, glass negatives, and a makeshift darkroom wherever she goes. The process requires great technical skill and is prone to accident. Rather than attempt conventional perfection, Mann embraces scrapes and fogged negatives that enhance a melancholic quality in her images. The outdated chemical process makes material the permanent impression of history on backcountry southern landscapes.",5714.0,"Artist

"Plane Filling I, March 1951, Maurits Cornelis Escher","M.C. Escher became interested in mezzotint due to its tonal range, and printed eight editions in the medium between 1946 and 1951. Like many of Escher’s perceptually dizzying but impeccably calculated images, this black-and-white composition of interlocking fish, fowl, primitive nudes, and mythical beasts can be read in several ways. Its light and dark contrasts form an overall geometrical pattern, like a chessboard run amok, or a jigsaw puzzle writhing with mutating pieces. The creatures may not be far removed from Hieronymus Bosch’s Renaissance-era views of the underworld, but Escher’s claustrophobic, patterned landscape is also full of delight.",5720.0,"Artist

Here Saint Mark’s haloed, noble beast stands at attention, emitting a stately roar. A banderole weaves between its legs in empty folds; this scroll was included so that the engraving’s owner could inscribe it with the story of Christ’s life and resurrection, as Mark described in his Gospel.",5730.0,"Artist

"Airborne Snotty Vase: Influenza, 2001, Marcel Wanders","Marcel Wanders’s Airborne Snotty Vase is a compelling and humorous example of the creative possibilities enabled by digital fabrication methods, such as high-tech scanning and printing techniques. Here Wanders endeavored to create beauty out of the grotesque by giving visual form to the shape of a human sneeze. Made from an enlarged three-dimensional digital recording of the microscopic mucus particles emitted during a sneeze, this vase was constructed from layers of polyamide powder fused together by heat from a laser beam using rapid prototyping technology. Holes to hold flowers were added to the design during the digital editing stage to transform this biological process into a functional vase.",5733.0,"Artist

"Tunic, Early/mid–20th century, Yoruba","The Yoruba appreciate the color variations and sparkling surfaces of beads, as well as the way that they can be combined into dazzling patterns. Beads contain àse (animating force) and become further imbued with it when worn. Today titled Yoruba men wear beaded regalia as an expression of power, status, and divine sanction. This tunic’s imagery refers to power and domination. Two male figures flank the front opening, while on the back a coiled snake sits beneath another male figure, possibly holding a shield. Around these motifs and on the sides and arms are geometric patterns. [See also 2009.581].",5734.0,"Culture

"Sugar Caster with Cover (one of a pair), c. 1737, Meissen Porcelain Manufactory","By the 17th century, many European nations were trading heavily in the Orient, importing such products as tea, chocolate, furniture, silk, and porcelain. The discovery in the 18th century of the secret method the Chinese used to make porcelain was one of the most important achievements of the royal Meissen porcelain factory near Dresden. The tureen from this centerpiece and stand with a pair of sugar casters, designed by Meissen’s chief modeler, Johann Joachim Kändler, would have been filled with lemons. Very sculptural in quality, the ensemble is animated with Oriental figures, Buddhas, imaginary birds, antique masks, flowers, and insects.",5748.0,"Artist
