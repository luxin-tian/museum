"Boy in the Country, 1857, Claude Monet","This energetic study comes from a sketchbook that Monet kept when he was no more than 17 years old. Since none of his paintings from this period survive, the work offers a rare glimpse of his early talent. His chosen subject—perhaps a native of his coastal hometown, Le Havre—could well have been captured spontaneously. The boy’s clothing obscures his anatomy, but the outlines of his smock are crisp and decisive. It seems as if the artist applied considerable pressure to the pencil. In describing the tufts of grass, he appears to have indented the page.",5751.0,"Artist

"The Superb Lily, from The Temple of Flora, 1799, Richard Earlom","In 1810, Richard John Thornton published the following “Apology” to his subscribers, explaining why his project of botanical illustrations remained incomplete:
It was my original idea, had the times been propitious, to have greatly enlarged this part of the work, and presented the world with seventy PICTURESQUE BOTANICAL COLOURED PLATES, in which case another distribution of them would have been made, and every class illustrated by SELECT EXAMPLES of the most interesting flowers, accurately described, and immortalized by poetry: but during the progress of this expensive work, with the exception of a few months respite, infuriate war has constantly and violently raged, which, like a devouring conflagration, destroys everything before it; commerce, agriculture and The Arts, all the sources of public prosperity, and private happiness, are by it dried up and annihilated.",5754.0,"Artist

"The Farmer Wanted a Boy, 1942, Robert Gwathmey","Known for depicting the plight of impoverished southern African Americans with dignity and sensitivity, Robert Gwathmey concentrated on destitute rural whites in The Farmer Wanted a Boy. World War II has taken the young men away, leaving the elderly, women, and children to fend for themselves. Yet the central focus on the infant and the title of the work suggests an optimistic meaning despite the grimness of the scene. The baby can be seen as a beacon of hope amidst the surrounding turmoil and depair; he is the only one in the composition not weighed down, literally and figuratively, by the overwhelming burden of poverty.",5758.0,"Artist

"The Anatomical Lesson of Professor Pauw, 1615, Jacob de Gheyn, II","Lucas Kilian’s Mirrors of the Microcosm (see 1944.461, .462, and .521) were very likely used for reference in the Leiden University anatomy theater, as a set of the 1613 broadsides entered the collection in 1618. The theater already had a tradition of teaching from prints during dissections. In 1598, its founder, Professor Pieter Pauw, had forty prints after Vesalius framed and pasted onto a board for the walls of the theater. The flap broadsides were likely used in a similar didactic manner. Pauw also installed skeletons (visible in the background) and skulls (under the table) to educate his students as well as decorate the space and remind spectators of their impending demise.",5762.0,"Artist

"Untitled Film Still #50, 1979, printed 1983, Cindy Sherman","One of the most celebrated figures in contemporary art, Cindy Sherman made her groundbreaking series Untitled Film Stills between 1977 and 1980. The photographs evoke the 8x10–inch film stills, or “glossies,“ taken by photographers on movie sets and used to promote Hollywood productions since the silent film era. In each photograph, Sherman poses as a star actress in an imaginary movie, deploying cinematic conventions like pose, lighting, and camera angle to imitate the look and feel of films from the 1950s and ’60s. Using carefully chosen costumes and settings, Sherman’s images draw attention to the construction of stereotypical female types in popular media. This photograph alternately depicts the objectified or vulnerable woman: Sherman’s rigid pose takes on the lifeless quality of a mannequin frozen in time, but also suggests a moment of suspense in which a startling event may take place at any second.",5773.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1965, Bruce Nauman","In the mid-1960s, Bruce Nauman began making sculptural casts, questioning several of the assumptions that have attended the process throughout its history. He rejected the traditional use of a mold in the production of a technically perfect cast object. In Nauman’s earliest extant sculptures of 1965—a group of 11 elongated, vaguely anthropomorphic fiberglass works—he described his process as ""making a mold, taking the two halves and putting them together to make a hollow shape and turning it inside out."" In these early pieces, the artist was testing the notion of sculpture as a medium of solid, durable forms, thus turning the assumptions of sculpture, as well as the form, inside out.",5774.0,"Artist

"Untitled (L’Abeille), April 7, 1966, Joseph Cornell","Cornell’s works sometimes gave the appearance, as in this case, of being wholly ready made. Only at second glance do they reveal his additions and alterations to the original found object. In Untitled (L’Abeille), the frame resembles the frames of his boxes, thereby suggesting a genre somewhere in between collage and construction. The blue staining that runs down the inside of the glass on each side of the text enhances its antique look, and the gold bees are added so subtly that they seem part of the fancy advertising for the company, L’Abeille, offering daily trips for English visitors in Belgium to Waterloo. The latter had become a tourist attraction, as the site of Napoleon’s defeat in 1812 at the hands of the English. Cornell may also have been attracted by the slight misprints on this notice (“THESE AND BACK,” for instance), which reinforce the idea of the foreign. A contemporary English audience would find a further oddity in this announcement, since it would immediately identify Waterloo as the London railway station. As indicated by the inscription on the back of this work, Cornell dedicated this collage to Jacques Brel (1929–1978), the French songwriter and singer, who became internationally known after 1957 and toured the United States in the 1960s.",5778.0,"Artist

"Willow Bridge and Waterwheel, c. 1650, Hasegawa Sôya","The gold bridge spanning the twelve panels of this pair is a quintessential folding screen subject, and several versions of this design exist. The location pictured is Uji, an area of great spiritual significance and a link between the ancient cities of Nara and Kyoto. By the Edo period (1615–1868), certain elements were sufficient to evoke the famous site: the curved bridge, willows, moon, waterwheel, trailing mist, and rock-filled baskets are all elements taken from classical poetry.
The artist Hasegawa Soya was the son of Hasegawa Tohaku (1539–1610), an innovator in producing dynamic large-format works. An impressive amount of precious materials went into the fabrication of this pair. Gold and silver were used in leaf form on the bridge and moon, as cut squares and dust in the clouds, and as paint for the lines of the current. Gold paint has also been used over oyster-shell-white pigment (gofun) to create a raised effect in the baskets and the waterwheel. In addition, the application of the gold leaf diagonally to accentuate the curve of the bridge is a rare feature.",5785.0,"Artist

"Model Reading in the Studio, c. 1849, Gustave Courbet","Life drawing from the nude was an integral part of the rigorous academic training an artist might traditionally receive in Paris and other major cities in the 19th century. Only after beginning with rote copying from prints and plaster casts after the antique would qualified, usually male, students progress to the nude model. The highly finished drawings that resulted from these sessions hearken back to Classical sculpture in their definition of relief and generally demonstrate more the respective technical aptitude of these young artists than their creative potential. Paul Cézanne and Gustav Klimt’s nudes are particularly difficult to recognize as autograph, although they underline the dramatic journey made by these artists to their mature styles. Luminous in surface handling and a tendency toward allegory, Edward Burne-Jones’ sketchbook nudes are less rigorous in their anatomical detail, while Auguste Rodin’s cropped female form floats across the page as an ode to the theme of eternal feminine. Conversely, the subject of Gustave Courbet’s Model Reading exhibits partial undress rather than complete nudity in a moment of quiet introspection between her modeling sessions.",5794.0,"Artist

"Model Reading in the Studio, c. 1849, Gustave Courbet","The diminishing influence of the Academy, and its advocacy of realistic painting, infused a short-lived periodical, Le nu esthètique (The aesthetic nude). Produced shortly after the emergence of photography helped nudge painting toward greater abstraction, this publication offered decoratively laid-out photographs of female, male, and child nudes in varying poses and allegorical guises, purportedly for artists to study from life. No corresponding paintings are known, but the ultimate academician Jean-Léon Gerôme’s introduction suggests its audience was intended to be a new generation of academic painters.",5794.0,"Artist
