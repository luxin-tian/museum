"Breadwinner (War), 1942, John Wilson","The drawing Breadwinner depicts an African American worker relaxing on a park bench during his break. The man wears a hat typical of a factory laborer. In spite of his ordinary appearance, the man’s posture is strong and relaxed, and he wears a sport coat over his work clothes—a symbol of pride for men during the Depression. On his lap is a newspaper with the discernable headline “WAR.” John Wilson made this drawing in 1942, probably soon after the United States declared war on the Axis powers.",5801.0,"Artist

"Studies of Lions, c. 1829, Eugène Delacroix","Delacroix created these preliminary images for the nearby Lion of the Atlas Mountains (1927.1646), which would appear in reverse as a result of the printmaking process. Experimenting with several positions for the lion’s prey, and two expressions for the feline itself, this abbreviated sheet suggests several close sessions at the Jardin des Plantes. Ever diligent in his research, Delacroix even sought permission to arrive before the zoo opened to the public, to watch the lions being fed.",5810.0,"Artist

"Pomona Surprised by Vertumnus and Other Suitors, from The Story of Vertumnus and Pomona, 1535/40, Bernard van Orley","The young woman kneeling in the foreground, holding a branch with leaves and flowers, is Pomona, the Roman nymph of apples and orchards. The young man shown in profile to her immediate right is Vertumnus, the Proteus-like god who symbolized the passing of the seasons. The tapestry is part of a Story of Vertumnus and Pomona suite that is based on the mythological tale Ovid described in the Metamorphoses. According to the story, Vertumnus was in love with the beautiful Pomona, who was devoted to gardening and uninterested in courtship. He tried to woo her, at first in vain, but eventually won her heart. The tapestry is the first scene of five and depicts Pomona’s disinterest in all the various suitors shown. The series to which this piece belongs is the earliest surviving narrative ensemble illustrating the entirety of Ovid’s tale.",5815.0,"Artist

"Oinochoe (Pitcher), about 440 BC, Ancient Greek","Below the pouring spout of this shiny black vessel is a youthful musician holding a seven-stringed lyre, its sound box rendered to look like tortoiseshell. The plectrum, or pick, is tied to the lowermost of the instrument’s two upright bars. A himation, or mantle, falls from his left shoulder. Unusually, he wears leggings. The wreath encircling his head is a common accessory of symposium attendees. Perhaps he has or will perform for the gathering of men.",5819.0,"Culture

"Sea, Green and Brown, Maine, 1937, John Marin","This unusually somber watercolor must have been painted indoors on a dark day or possibly at nightfall, when the sea appeared almost black. Marin captured this view from the glass porch of the Cape Split house at high tide, when the large triangular rock known as the tide marker was barely visible; the tip of a coastal ledge juts into the picture at the left. The artist here used directional wiping, blending in opaque watercolor. Movement and brightness were introduced by scraping away pigment to reveal the white paper, conjuring the breaking surf playing about the submerged rocks.",5822.0,"Artist

"Walker Warehouse, 1953, Aaron Siskind","In the 1930s Aaron Siskind was active in the New York Photo League, leading classes of advanced students in a social documentary project called the Feature Group. Meanwhile, he undertook photographic studies of vernacular architecture on Martha’s Vineyard and in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. When he came to teach at Chicago’s Institute of Design in 1951 (where he remained for 20 years), he was thus perfectly suited to lead the Sullivan Project, a three-year, comprehensive documentation of the buildings in the city designed by the influential architect Louis Sullivan. In the 1950s, urban planners and developers across Chicago undertook massive demolition projects that brought down scores of Sullivan’s outstanding creations. Siskind photographed the Walker Warehouse, designed in 1886–89, just as it was being torn down, focusing on Sullivan’s elegant use of ornament even in utilitarian structures. Siskind’s picture emphasizes the shallowness of space and the play of light within the image’s rectangular boundaries.",5827.0,"Artist

"Chous (Toy Pitcher), 430/410 BC, Ancient Greek","Toward the end of the 5th century B.C., Athenian potters and painters created a large number of miniature oinochoai (sing. oinochoe), or pitchers, decorated with children at play or imitating adults. It is thought that they were given to the youngest members of the family during the Anthesteria, a three-day celebration of the new vintage of wine and the arrival of spring. These little vessels are called choes (sing. chous), which means libations, after the name of the second day of the festival. Children took part in the festival but did not imbibe wine. On this example, a naked boy crawls toward a young bird on a perch. A chous hangs on the wall above him.",5834.0,"Culture
