"Chasuble with Orphrey Band, Chasuble: Late 15th century; Orphrey Band: Late 15th/early 16th century","This chasuble’s motif, the pomegranate, was the predominate textile motif, along with related forms such as pomegranate thistles and pineapples, during the 15th century. Church specification dictated that all chasubles had to be made of silk, the most expensive and most precious of all materials. Quite frequently gold and silver threads were used to embellish the back of the chasuble as seen in this example. The Orphrey band, which was added at a later time, depict the Madonna and child, St. Peter, and an unidentified saint, who was probably a local patron.",5858.0,"Title

"Punch Pot, 1755/65","Considerably larger than a teapot, this vessel was probably used for punch, a hot drink made with red wine and spices that was a popular beverage in 18th-century England. The naturalism of the handle and spout, modeled in the form of crabapple branches, contrasts with the imaginative freedom of the colorful painted figures. The unknown artist took these vignettes from a series of prints engraved after the work of the French artist François Boucher (1703–1770).",5865.0,"Title

"The Quick and the Dead, 1950/55, Ed Van Der Elsken","The Dutch photographer Ed van der Elsken arrived in Paris in the years following World War II and joined the circle of radical avant–gardes led by Marxist theorist Guy Debord. He meandered with his camera through the jazz bars, cafés, and restaurants of Saint–Germain–des–Prés, producing a series of photographs that captured the rebellious youth culture of that time, later published as the book Love on the Left Bank. Shot in quick succession, these two street views show police dispersing a crowd of demonstrators and employ an aerial perspective that contrasts starkly with the casual intimacy found in most of Elsken’s images. Yet they reflect a parallel concern with the state of postwar French society, which he indicted as “bourgeois, individualistic, decadent, rotten and deadly … with nothing to offer its young people.”",5872.0,"Artist

"The Annunciation, from a Book of Hours, 1440/45, Master of the Privileges of Ghent and Flanders","Books of Hours were the most popular book of the Middle Ages and Renaissance; more of them were produced from c. 1250–1550 than any other type of book, devotional or otherwise. This example has been attributed to the workshop of the prolific Master of the Ghent Privileges, and characteristically ornaments a sequence of prayers and devotional reading to be recited at precisely set times of the day and night. Images such as this tender scene of the encounter between the Virgin and her cousin Saint Elizabeth, both miraculously with child, helped introduce the different segments of the Hours of the Virgin, the core section of all Books of Hours.",5884.0,"Artist

"What May Come (Mexico, 1945), 1945, Leopoldo Méndez","A signal image in Méndez’s oeuvre, this work is one of only three self-portrait prints made by the artist. Also known as Danger over Mexico and That Which Must Not Come, the print reflects upon the role of the politically engaged artist in Mexico at the end of World War II, a period of great uncertainty. In the print, the figure of Méndez lies across an open sketchbook and contemplates a nightmarish vision in which Mexican national symbols—the eagle, snake, and nopal cactus (references to the legend of the founding of Tenochtitlan, ancient Mexico City)—are grotesquely inverted, and social order is threatened by reactionary forces. The eagle, symbol of the Mexican republic, hangs on a swastika-cross, and behind, a column of fascist soldiers, supported by Catholic clerics, marches on Mexico City. The museum’s Print and Drawing Club commissioned Méndez to make the woodblock for this print.",5889.0,"Artist

"What May Come (Mexico, 1945), 1945, Leopoldo Méndez","Español:
Imagen señera de la obra de Méndez, éste es uno de los únicos tres autorretratos en grabado realizados por el artista. También conocido como Amenaza sobre México y Lo que no debe venir, el grabado es una reflexión sobre el papel del artista y su compromiso político con México hacia el final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, que fue un periodo de gran incertidumbre. En el grabado, la figura de Méndez yace recostada boca abajo sobre un gran libro de bocetos abierto mientras contempla una visión pesadillesca. En ella los símbolos nacionales mexicanos el águila, la serpiente y el nopal (referencias a la leyenda de la fundación de Tenochtitlán) aparecen grotescamente trastocados y el orden social se ve amenazado por fuerzas de la reacción. El águila, símbolo de la República Mexicana, cuelga de una cruz gamada, mientras una fila de soldados fascistas, con apoyo de la curia católica, marcha sobre la Ciudad de México. El Club de Grabados y Dibujos del museo comisionó a Méndez el bloque en madera para este grabado.",5889.0,"Artist

"Phiale (Shallow Bowl for Pouring Ritual Libations), 300/250 BC, Ancient Greek","During the course of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C., black vessels like this one (commonly called black-glaze vessels) were made with increasing frequency in both Greece and South Italy.

"Study for “An Aragonese Smuggler”, 1881, William Turner Dannat","This is a preparatory study for a large-scale, full-length composition of a peasant boy stealing a drink from a pitcher. William Turner Dannat trained in Munich and later in Paris, drawing inspiration from 17th-century Spanish masters like Diego Velázquez, as did his teachers, including the Hungarian painter Mihály Munkácsy. Dannat’s realist style, characterized by loose, expressive brushstrokes, is evident in both this study and in the final painting. The French government purchased An Aragonese Smuggler (1883; Château de Blérancourt) when it was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1883. This study is one of the Art Institute’s earliest acquisitions, entering the collection in 1887.",5895.0,"Artist
