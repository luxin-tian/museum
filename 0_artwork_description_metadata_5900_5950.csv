"Door, c. 1750, Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo","First sparked by the accounts of Marco Polo’s 13th-century voyage to China, the Italian vogue for chinoiserie (Chinese-inspired motifs) was later reinforced by the Venetian Republic’s extensive trade with the East. The city-state’s aristocrats ordered entire rooms to be decorated in Chinese style. One palace on the Grand Canal, the Ca’Rezzonico, now a museum of decorative arts, was lavishly decorated by the Rezzonico family after they purchased it in 1750. In addition to commissioning the painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and his son Giandomenico to create frescoes for the ceilings, the Rezzonicos followed contemporary fashion by decorating at least one room with Orientalist motifs.",5901.0,"Artist

"Door, c. 1750, Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo","This door from the palace depicts two scenes that provide glimpses of Western perceptions of the East. In the upper panel, a noble couple meets in front of a palm tree; in the lower panel, a pipe-smoking potentate is being served tea. Both scenes are framed by bright sprays of flowers connected with flowing ribbons. The smooth, many layered surface of the lemon yellow door was achieved through lacquering, a technique borrowed from China but practiced in the West with an oil-based mixture rather than the resin-based one employed by Chinese craftsmen.",5901.0,"Artist

"Vessel Depicting a Sacrificial Ceremony for a Royal Accession, A.D. 650/800, Maya","This vessel, used to consume a chocolate drink, depicts a key event in a royal Maya accession ceremony, which shows the relationship between human sacrifice and the assumption of power. The expectant king is flanked by servants, musicians, and masked nobles, while a terrified captive—bound to a scaffold—awaits his death. It is probable that the victim was a warrior from a rival community defeated by the prospective king during a coronation war. Such sacrifices were required as proof of a new ruler’s military abilities, provided an offering to his patron gods, and served as a sign of the triumphant reign to follow.",5906.0,"Culture

"Aryballos (Container for Oil), 625/600 BC, Ancient Greek","Situated at the crossroads of Mediterranean trade routes, the Etruscans were avid importers of Greek vases with figural decoration. Many of these vessels survive today because they were buried with their Etruscan owners, and were discovered in tombs only during the last several centuries. This piece was made by a local artist who quickly adopted the decorative motifs and painted styles of imported wares and adapted them to local tastes in order to capture some of the market.",5917.0,"Culture

"Winged Horse, 1920, John Bradley Storrs","Chicago artist John Storrs spent most of his career in France but retained ties to his native city. His Winged Horse was executed in Paris and demonstrates his adoption of French modernist abstraction and geometric simplification. The design’s impetus, however, was American: Storrs conceived the work as a model for a large-scale monument to honor one of his idols, the poet Walt Whitman. The artist wrote that Whitman “stands practically alone as one who has discovered a national soul and has given it expression in a form that can be called beautiful—that can be called art.” Regrettably, Storrs never found financial backing for his project.",5921.0,"Artist

"Cremaster 3: The Dance of Hiram Abiff, 2002, Matthew Barney","Matthew Barney is a sculptor who makes photographs, films, books, live performances, and objects. For him, no medium is subsidiary to any other; all are expressions in different forms of the same ideas. Barney is, however, by far best known for his films. The five feature-length films of the Cremaster series comprise a gorgeous, absurdly complex epic. Purposely made out of sequence to discourage attempts at linear analysis and to emphasize the circular quality of the narrative, this densely interconnected project began with Cremaster 4 (1995, filmed on the Isle of Man, followed by Cremaster 1 (1996, filmed in Boise, Idaho), Cremaster 5 (1997, filmed in Budapest, Hungary), and Cremaster 2 (1999, filmed in and around the Great Salt Lake in Utah). The final film Cremaster 3 (2001, filmed mostly in New York City) is the longest and perhaps most crucial portion of the narrative. These four prints, which display characters, settings, and events from the end of the narrative, are not still images from the film. Rather, the photographs were posed separately from the filming and are presented together to connect and underscore particular scenes from the motion picture. These images center on the crown of the Chrysler Building turned into a maypole, and the Architect, Hiram Abiff (played by the artist Richard Serra), participating in a climactic rite that prematurely celebrates the building’s completion. The first and fourth images show workers festooning the crown with ribbons. The second shows Abiff at the center of a “maypole” dance. The third shows the unfinished building protruding into the sky in its quest to be the tallest structure in the city.",5925.0,"Artist

"A Rolling Sky, Paris, After Storm, 1908, John Marin","One of 15 watercolors that Marin showed at the 1908 Salon d’Automne in Paris, this early work was also included in his first exhibition at Stieglitz’s Little Galleries of the Photo Secession (known simply as 291) in the spring of 1909. A view of barges along the Seine River at the Petit Pont, the watercolor is crowned by gradually dissipating gray and purple storm clouds. Fragile beams of sunlight begin to break through, creating a mood balanced between ominous and hopeful. The artist harnessed his color palette to subtly communicate the feelings associated with a departing storm: touches of pink and yellow indicate that the worst is over, while darker and cooler washes capture the lingering aura of the deluge.",5928.0,"Artist

"Icon Plaque (Kakebotoke) with Bosatsu, 13th century","Icon plaques, or kakebotoke, were widely produced beginning in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) for use in both Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. Their circular form derives from the shape of polished bronze mirrors. Earlier kakebotoke were made of bronze, with images engraved with fine lines. Circular wood plaques such as this one, with attached cast images and repoussé ornamentation, supplanted these. The plaques were hung under the eaves of temples, where they could be seen and worshipped by multiple people at once.",5930.0,"Title
