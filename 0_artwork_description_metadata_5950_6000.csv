"Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn), 1890/91, Claude Monet","The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series Stacks of Wheat rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist’s farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s Stacks of Wheat in the world.",5953.0,"Artist

"What Is This Picasso?, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","Since the early 1960s, David Hockney has sought ways to meld his modern aesthetic style with highly personalized subject matter. He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.",5958.0,"Artist

"What Is This Picasso?, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.",5958.0,"Artist

"Art Institute of Chicago Addition, Concept Sketch Perspective, 2001, Renzo Piano","New wings, additions, and visitors’ centers built in the 21st century reflect evolving cultural discourses and institutional identities. These projects use various strategies to respond to contemporary agendas while respecting the existing structure of buildings. For the addition to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, José Rafael Moneo decided not to emulate the institution’s older buildings. Instead, the new structure would allow the MFAH campus to be seen as an eclectic compilation of architectural styles. At the Art Institute of Chicago, Renzo Piano intended for the new wing not only to host galleries but to serve as a connector between Millennium Park and the heart of the existing museum, actively linking it with urban life.",5962.0,"Artist

"Glaive of the Bodyguard of August I, Elector of Saxony, 1580","Pole arms (staff weapons) were used not only in warfare and hunting, but also in sporting combat and ceremonies. The term refers to a family of edged weapons attached to wooden staffs. With the exception of the lance, which remained the weapon of the mounted knight, all other staff weapons were wielded by men on foot by 1600. With the development of firearms and their introduction as infantry weapons, pole arms lost their importance on the field, and from the mid-16th century, they were reserved for use in sporting contests and by princely bodyguards for ceremony and parade. The blades lent themselves to embellishment—engraving, etching, or other forms of decoration—and provided a perfect surface for the coats of arms of noble or princely families. The ceremonial use of staff weapons continues to this day with the Swiss Guards at the Vatican and Britain’s Yeomen of the Royal Guard.",5963.0,"Title

This impression is a fine, dark and early first state, before the artist’s signature and a poem were added at the bottom.
