"Self-Portrait (No. 18), 1983, Ivan Albright","In 1981 Albright began a series of drawn and painted self-portraits at the invitation of the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence, which for four centuries has collected other significant examples of this motif.

"The Girl at the Window, 1894, Edvard Munch","As the current exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity demonstrates, women in the late 19th century were regularly defined by their attire. Clothing, makeup, and accessories frequently reflected not only a woman’s social status but also her character and morality. Scholar Justine De Young has observed of the period, “Dressing fashionably and in good taste thus became one of the central concerns of a bourgeois woman’s daily life, as not merely her appearance but also her reputation was at stake.” The same strict rules of public presentation did not necessarily apply, however, to the private, domestic sphere—as the images in this gallery illustrate. Shown here are women in the process of dressing or undressing; relaxing in their underclothes, nightgowns, or morning dress; or in the most private of moments: sleeping or reclining nude. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s print portfolio Elles most likely depicts prostitutes during the course of the day, but these prints could easily represent the interior life of any woman, as they illustrate common boudoir behaviors: the toilette, lounging in bed, grooming, and conversing with friends. Prints by Childe Hassam, Edvard Munch, James McNeill Whistler, and Paul Gavarni show women wearing peignoirs or dressing gowns. These garments were typically worn by upper class women while they went about their regular morning activities: attending to the servants or the children, catching up on reading and correspondence, and other routine household concerns.",6025.0,"Artist

"Jupiter and Callisto, 1560/70, Domenico Vito","In Roman mythology, Callisto is a nymph of Diana, the goddess of chastity. Jupiter, disguised as Diana and with the help of Cupid, seduces and impregnates Callisto.
Domenico Vito, an Italian monk and printmaker, based his Jupiter and Callisto on Pierre Milan’s engraving, after Francesco Primaticcio’s fresco in the Palace of Fontainebleau. Primaticcio was a member of the First School of Fontainebleau, a group of Italian masters brought into France by Francis I to decorate the royal palace. In 1542 Primaticcio set up a school of printmaking, where Milan was a member.",6027.0,"Artist

"Two Tiles with Continuous Floral Pattern, Ottoman dynasty (1299–1923), c.1560, Islamic","During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, at the height of the Ottoman Empire, ceramic vessels and tiles of remarkable artistic and technical quality were produced at Iznik, a city in northwestern Anatolia. The middle of the sixteenth century was an important moment in the evolution of Iznik wares. To the existing blue-and-white palette was added color: first turquoise, green, and purple, then a red slip. The earlier focus on tableware was supplemented by a new demand for architectural tilework. Also at this time a new style emerged that emphasized floral motifs, such as familiar flowers (roses, carnations, tulips, etc.), as well as compositions of leaves and palmettes. The enduring quality of Iznik at its best and most representative is the effect of bold patterning in brilliant polychrome set against a pure white ground.",6034.0,"Culture

"Two Tiles with Continuous Floral Pattern, Ottoman dynasty (1299–1923), c.1560, Islamic","The design here consists of elaborate palmettes and sinuously writhing leaves with serrated edges. Rosettes are half-covered by leaves, which, in turn, are pierced by stems. This pattern is typical of the so-called saz style, a term that derives from the words saz kalem, or “reed pen.” The style developed in album drawings in black ink executed during the second half of the sixteenth century and became widely popular in various media. The two works in the Art Institute’s collection can be dated to about 1560, the apogee of Iznik tile production. They were meant to be contiguous since the pattern continues effortlessly from one to the other.",6034.0,"Culture

"Title Page from Diversae Insectorum, after 1644, Wenceslaus Hollar","A prolific and multitalented artist, Wenceslaus Hollar produced almost 3,000 etchings over the course of some 50 years, with subjects ranging from fashion and portraiture to architecture and landscape. This etching is the title page to a set of six scientific renderings of insects and other small creatures. Remarkable for their virtuosity and detail, the technical presentation of these works is most likely attributed to the invention of the microscope at the end of the 16th century.",6035.0,"Artist

"Mrs. Henry Hill (Anna Barrett), c. 1765/70, John Singleton Copley","In 2006 the Art Institute of Chicago was lucky enough to acquire John Singleton Copley’s pastel Henry Hill, the companion to Mrs. Henry Hill (Anna Barrett) which has been in the collection since 1959. Both pastels retain their original Rococo-style frames. They may have been carved by the Boston cratsman John Welch, who created many of Copley’s Rococo frames, the type the artist used most frequently for his American portraits. The frame on Mrs. Henry Hill was gilded, as this was generally appropriate for the Rococo style; however, recent scholarship has revealed that a few Copley frames, like that of Henry Hill, were painted black. Thus, these portraits present two different ways that Copley’s frames might have been finished.",6039.0,"Artist

"Street Corner, from Some Aspects of Paris Life, 1897, Pierre Bonnard","Like Vuillard, Bonnard fixed his attention on his immediate surroundings and the activities of everyday life. Whereas Vuillard focused particularly on the domestic interior, Bonnard gained the reputation as a chronicler of city life. In the series Some Aspects of Paris Life, he presented his subject, the streets and aquares of the city, as an animated spectacle where the identification of landmarks and specific topography is eschewed in favor of expressing the city’s bold patterns and rhythms.",6047.0,"Artist
