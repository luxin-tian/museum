"On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt, 1868, Claude Monet","Here Claude Monet’s future wife, Camille Doncieux, sits on an island in the Seine River, looking toward the hamlet of Gloton, next to the town of Bennecourt, from which she and Monet have presumably rowed. This is the only painting to survive from the brief period that the couple spent in Gloton, which the novelist Émile Zola recommended to Monet as a cheap rural retreat that was easily accessible from Paris. Pentimenti (underpainting) suggest that in an early stage of the painting, Camille held a bonneted child, presumably the couple’s baby, Jean.",603.0,"Artist

"Red Hills with Flowers, 1937, Georgia O’Keeffe","Fascinated by contrasts in scale, Georgia O’Keeffe frequently juxtaposed enlarged still-life elements with far-off landscapes, as seen in Black Cross, New Mexico. She continued this practice in Red Hills with Flowers, an image of vibrant flowers magnified and set against the red hills that surrounded her New Mexico home. The striking colors of the land intrigued her, and she later equated the area’s myriad hues with artist paints: “All the earth colors of the painter’s palette are out there in the many miles of badlands. The light Naples yellow through the ochers—orange and red and purple earth—even the soft earth greens.”",606.0,"Artist

"Apples and Grapes, 1880, Claude Monet","Claude Monet probably painted this and other still lifes in 1879–80, knowing that they would be more readily marketable than his landscapes. In Apples and Grapes, however, he employed the complexity of color, light, and texture found in his most Impressionist landscapes. This is particularly evident in the extensive cloth surface—the play of light on the horizontal brushstrokes (indicating the folds in the tablecloth) recalls earlier canvases in which Monet used similar short horizontals of variegated colors to suggest water rippling in the sunlight.",610.0,"Artist

"The Artist’s House at Argenteuil, 1873, Claude Monet","Claude Monet and his family lived at Argenteuil, outside Paris, from 1871 to 1878. Here he depicted his five- or six-year-old son, Jean, playing with a hoop and his wife, Camille, standing in the doorway of their vine-covered house. The pleasant weather and neatly kept garden, a forerunner of the artist’s celebrated garden at Giverny, give a sense of tranquility and well-being to this painting. This was a period of financial security for Monet thanks to recent sales of his work to the Paris art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel.",615.0,"Artist

"Oil Sketch for “La Grande Jatte”, 1884, Georges Seurat","This small oil on a thin wood panel is one of 24 painted studies Georges Seurat made while conceiving the large, celebrated painting A Sunday on La Grande Jatte. Although at first glance, the panel seems close to the larger canvas, its 20 or more figures have little to do with the final composition. The trio at right, for example, with the elderly seated figure, was completely rethought in the final composition, in which a man in a top hat and a woman walking a monkey convey a sense of grand solemnity and wry humor—a sophisticated irony that is completely absent in the clumsily positioned figures of the oil panel.",620.0,"Artist

"Belly-Amphora (Storage Jar), About 550/540 BC, Ancient Greek","Ancient artists frequently depicted events from the life of the demigod Herakles, especially the Twelve Labors he had to complete to attain immortality. On this amphora (storage jar) the great hero completes his first assignment—to kill a lion with an invincible hide that was terrorizing the village of Nemea. Here the contest has been decided; Herakles strangles the lion, whose jaws he has pried open with his bare hands. To the right stand Athena and Hermes; on the other stand a nymph and Iolaos, Herakles’s nephew and companion. In subsequent episodes, Herakles often wears the lion’s pelt, either as a headdress or over his arm, as a protective cloak.",626.0,"Culture

"Final Study for “Bathers at Asnières”, 1883, Georges Seurat","Georges Seurat’s monumental Bathers at Asnières (1884), for which this is a preparatory work, is now in the National Gallery, London. A scene of men and boys on the bank of the Seine River in the working-class suburb of Asnières, it differs greatly in mood from the sparkling scenes of riverside leisure painted by Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Nevertheless, the focus on modernity, use of pure, light pigments, and airy brushwork shows how this young artist furthered the most progressive tendencies of “classic” Impressionism. The same year he exhibited this painting he also began making studies of a site directly across the river for his monumental Sunday on La Grande Jatte.",629.0,"Artist

"The Races at Longchamp, 1866, Édouard Manet","With a characteristic focus on the pleasures of modern life, Édouard Manet depicted this scene of the racetrack in the Bois de Boulogne, on the western outskirts of Paris. The popularity of Longchamp, where races were run for the first time in 1857, signaled a general revival in French horse racing. This painting records the last moments of a race, as the horses rush past the finish line, indicated by the pole with a circular top. Unlike traditional sporting artists, who always showed races from the side, Manet dared to compose the scene so that the throng of horses and jockeys thunders straight toward the viewer.",630.0,"Artist

Maxwell Street was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood on the city’s Near West Side, known for its large outdoor bazaar, sadly dismantled in the 1990s by development. These prints show a crowded marketplace, a vendor at work, a student in deep concentration, and a pair of street musicians.

"Farm near Duivendrecht, c. 1916, Piet Mondrian","Though Piet Mondrian is best known for his nonrepresentational paintings, his basic vision was rooted in landscape. He was particularly inspired by the flat topography of his native Holland, a subject he returned to even after he had begun working in an abstract style after attending an exhibition of the Cubist paintings of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in 1911. Mondrian first sketched this farm around 1905. Nine of the twenty known related paintings and drawings of the farm, however, were created later, during World War I. Mondrian likely returned to the subject because his wartime patrons generally preferred his earlier naturalistic compositions to his recent experiments with Cubism.",633.0,"Artist

"Poppy Field (Giverny), 1890/91, Claude Monet","In July 1890, Claude Monet began four almost identically scaled canvases showing poppy fields near his home in Giverny. Although he did not consider these to be a series, like the 25 paintings of stacks of wheat that he began shortly after the harvest that same summer, the works certainly show his growing interest in developing several canvases at once. They also demonstrate a far more homogeneous touch than the freely brushed landscapes of his earlier career, with surfaces that have a tapestry-like materiality.",639.0,"Artist

Capturing a quintessentially Impressionist setting—a sun-dappled landscape with women and children enjoying leisure time—the artist also utilized the movement’s technique of broken brushwork and the use of brilliant colors. In the painting the children converse and frolic at the water’s edge on a windy day. There is nothing threatening about the waves or wind; indeed, Potthast’s paintings were both praised and criticized for presenting nothing other than a pleasant, innocent, and optimistic view.",642.0,"Artist

"Mrs. George Swinton (Elizabeth Ebsworth), 1897, John Singer Sargent","Mrs. George Swinton epitomizes the painterly virtuosity that made John Singer Sargent one of the most fashionable portraitists in late-19th-century Europe and America. Extravagant color and brushwork were central to Sargent’s success, as was his ability to present a refined and appealing image of his sitter. In Elizabeth “Elsie” Swinton’s case, he accentuated her regal bearing and feminine dress. Sargent harmonized the realism of her face and body with bursts of impressionistic brushstrokes describing the shimmering, translucent fabric descending from her shoulder. Swinton was also known for her musical talents; at the time her portrait was executed, she was recognized as an amateur singer and later began performing professionally.",644.0,"Artist

"Corpse and Mirror II, 1974/75, Jasper Johns","In his work from 1972 to 1983, Jasper Johns used a distinct arrangement of crosshatched marks, traditionally considered a graphic method of adding depth and volume to an image or conveying the illusion of light in space. Johns first glimpsed this pattern on a passing car, recalling: “I only saw it for a second, but knew immediately that I was going to use it. It had all the qualities that interest me—literalness, repetitiveness, an obsessive quality, order with dumbness, and the possibility of a complete lack of meaning.” Emphasizing the flatness of the painting, Johns’s cross-hatching is gestural without being emotive; in this sense, the technique extends his larger critique of overtly expressionist models of painting. Johns forged a new model of painterly abstraction, using a schema that is repeatable and ordered but not strictly geometric or reductive.",649.0,"Artist
