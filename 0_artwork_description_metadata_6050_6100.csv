"World’s Fair, New York City, 1964, Garry Winogrand","In 1964, a year in which race riots and the Beatles both exploded across the United States, Garry Winogrand received a Guggenheim fellowship and embarked on a cross-country trip that led him to take almost 20,000 images. Some of his most memorable photographs that year, however, were made in his native New York. Using a small 35mm camera, Winogrand redefined street photography, nimbly capturing chance juxtapositions and unconsciously repeated gestures. He photographed incessantly and swiftly, claiming, ""I photograph to find out what something will look like photographed."" This image was selected by John Szarkowski, then curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, as part of Women Are Beautiful, a 1975 portfolio of 85 images of women taken by Winogrand over a number of years.",6050.0,"Artist

"Section of a Buddhist Pagoda, Tang dynasty (A.D. 618–907), dated 724","Now separated for display, these slabs were once tightly aligned to form one chamber whose interior was visible only though a canopied doorway cut into the front slab. Dynamic guardians, flying apsaras (heavenly beings), writhing dragons, and an ogre mask protect this doorway, which opens into a sacred space. The Buddha, seated in the center, is flanked by two bodhisattvas (compassionate saintly beings) holding lotus flowers. The bodhisattvas’ fluid postures, which echo those of sensual images from contemporary Indian art, distinguish many Buddhist sculptures of early-eighth-century China.",6062.0,"Title

"Section of a Buddhist Pagoda, Tang dynasty (A.D. 618–907), dated 724","A long inscription, carved into the left side of both slabs, states that the family of Jia Heida commissioned this pagoda in honorable devotion to his deceased parents. Replete with Buddhist metaphors and allusions to the Buddha s life, this text opens with a bleak perspective on the physical world and then praises both Buddhist teachings of spiritual redemption and secular values of Chinese filial devotion. The inscription closes with a prayer extolling Buddhist principles.",6062.0,"Title

"Section of a Buddhist Pagoda, Tang dynasty (A.D. 618–907), dated 724","The back of the rear slab is incised with images of two brothers, the bodhisattvas of medicine, who vow to heal the sick. The elder brother (left) holds a bowl containing a lotus flower, which symbolizes medicine; the younger brother (right) joins his hands in prayer. A small figure in the lower-left corner, who reaches out with one arm, as if pleading for medicine, may represent a faithful devotee. Inscriptions along the far-left and far-right edges identify the patron of these images as Konghui, a Buddhist nun. Inscriptions to the left of both brothers offer praise to the bodhisattvas.",6062.0,"Title

"Commemorative Container (Abusua Kuruwa), Late 19th/early 20th century, Kwahu","From the 17th to the mid-20th century, the abusua kuruwa (literally, “family pot”) featured prominently in commemorative rituals for the nobility among the Asante and related peoples, including the Kwahu. This large, boldly embellished vessel takes the form of a storage container on which raised motifs—including snakes, a bird, and two male figures (one holding a rifle)—are applied. These had proverbial meanings or illustrated necessities, such as a chiefly entourage, that the deceased would require in the afterlife. A family pot was displayed during second burial celebrations and could be used on a shrine, as evidenced by this vessel’s crusty patina.",6065.0,"Culture

"Man’s Cap, 1575/1600","Nightcaps for men and their counterparts, coifs for women, were long-lived fashion, from about 1580 until 1650. With their heavy encrustations of decoration they were obviously not intended to be worn while sleeping. For the night wear a plain, warm, knitted woolen ""biggin"" was used. Like the woman’s cap, the man’s nightcap was meant for indoor wear during social hours at home. Persons of rank or professional men sat for their portraits in them.",6067.0,"Title

"To the Dance (Apaches), 1919, Léon Gaspard","The Russian émigré Léon Gaspard painted in Taos, New Mexico, from 1916 to 1919, finding a chromatic brilliance and folk culture reminiscent of his homeland there. After his return to Chicago, an exhibition of his work at the Art Institute attracted the attention of Julius Rosenwald—president of Sears, Roebuck and Company—and the lawyer Lessing Rosenthal. Together they gathered a group of 20 Jewish professionals to purchase To the Dance for the museum. The group’s support of Gaspard, a Jewish immigrant, signaled their commitment to a modernism based on cross-cultural affinities. They also may have felt a special regard for New Mexico, which was a tolerant home for Jews during the Spanish Inquisition.",6079.0,"Artist

"Collage, 1956/57, Harry Callahan","A self-taught photographer from Detroit, Harry Callahan became one of the most influential educators and practitioners of photography in America in the 20th century. Callahan built a body of work that was at once humanistic and restlessly experimental, ever pushing the boundaries of photographic conventions and materials. Callahan often set himself a challenge within strict technical or formal parameters—photographing, for example, female pedestrians on the street from a particular distance, or his wife and daughter in a series of posed 8 x 10–inch “snapshots.” In 1956–57 he experimented with collage, cutting up pieces of paper and fashion and advertising photographs, arranging them like a jigsaw puzzle in his studio, and photographing them as one would a still life. Callahan produced the collages in black and white and in color; the numerous faces and hands in this color composition give an impression of a mass of flesh.",6084.0,"Artist
