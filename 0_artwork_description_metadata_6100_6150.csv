"Celery Dish (“American Modern” Dinnerware), 1937/59, Russel Wright","An ardent promoter of modern design, Russel Wright developed his American Modern line of dinnerware, which included serving pieces such as this celery dish, in 1937. Wright claimed that the organic shapes of the pattern reflected each piece’s function and that muted colors such as cedar green were used in order to “dramatize” the service of food. Although Wright designed the line in 1937, American Modern was not produced until 1939 because of the skepticism of potential manufacturers during the Great Depression. Nonetheless, it has proved to be one of the most popular ceramic patterns ever created.",6106.0,"Artist

"The Sick Child, 1894, Edvard Munch","The intimate dramas playing out in this gallery draw their emotional power from the vulnerability of the exposed human form. Featured in these voyeuristic prints and drawings are private scenes of tragedy, tenderness, and horror, as artists intruded upon such previously forbidden settings as the bedroom, the deathbed, and the crime scene. While Félix Vallotton’s Intimacy woodcuts address the theme of undressing, with John Sloan’s playful Turning Out the Light and Gustav Klimt’s Seated Woman verging into the erotic, other images depict serious illnesses and the deaths of family members, especially children, which were commonplace events throughout the 19th century.",6107.0,"Artist

"The Sick Child, 1894, Edvard Munch","Making an explicit connection between sex and death is Otto Dix’s Murder, which pairs a bloody corpse with two dogs in the act of copulation. The Northern European artists Käthe Kollwitz and Edvard Munch drew on personal experiences for their devastating images of loss, seen here in stark scenes of grief. Kollwitz and the caricaturist Honoré Daumier (in an unusually somber mood) used similar iconographies of partially exposed corpses to make political statements: Daumier criticized the contemporary French government’s excessive response to a lower class riot in his Rue Transnonian, while Kollwitz drew on her own socialist sympathies in evoking war horrors in Raped, part of her series about the disastrous 1525 German Peasants’ War. The scattered feet of the family members in Daumier’s Transnonian and the nearly invisible child’s head to the left of Kollwitz’s splayed female body remind the viewer of these scenes’ universal themes.",6107.0,"Artist

"The Whore of Babylon, from The Apocalypse, 1496–98, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer’s illustrations of the Apocalypse display an unprecedented scale and complexity. In this sheet, the Whore of Babylon, one of the visions foretold in the biblical book of Revelation, is perched on a seven-headed scarlet beast with 10 horns, holding aloft a chalice full of the “abominations and filthiness of her fornication.” She appears in contemporary Italian dress, perhaps a reference to the burning city in the distance, which is commonly interpreted as Rome, whose seven hills matched the beast’s seven heads.",6110.0,"Artist

"Juvisy, France, 1955, printed 1956, Henri Cartier-Bresson","Henri Cartier-Bresson originated the phrase “the decisive moment”—the instant when everything in the camera’s frame aligns serendipitously to create the perfect composition. A founder of Magnum, a cooperative photographic agency formed in 1947 to give photographers creative control over their own images, Cartier-Bresson traveled the world as a photojournalist. The Art Institute acquired seven of his photographs in 1962, including this image of children playing beside the Seine, precisely framed and divided by gravel, pathways, and shrubs. Edwards later wrote in a letter: “There are many great photographs by Cartier-Bresson, but this always remains my favorite.”",6111.0,"Artist

"Alligator, 1985, Louise Lawler","Since the early 1980s, Louise Lawler has photographed works of art installed in auction houses, corporate headquarters, galleries, museums, and private homes in order to demonstrate how an object’s display and contextualization can shape its meaning. The resulting images transcend pure documentation. Her appropriation of works in situ addresses the broader social and economic issues that structure modes of presentation. These early photographs, often displayed as a triptych, deal with the theme of monogramming and, by extension, personal vanity. Depicting a couch with a Lacoste emblem, Alligator draws our attention to the Donald Judd sculpture above it and the reflection of the artist in its surface. Untitled shows a Jasper Johns painting, visible through the clear glass of a vitrine that exhibits Robert Rauschenberg’s oddly titled Monogram (1955–59; Moderna Museet, Stockholm). Lastly, Monogram depicts Johns’s White Flag (1955; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) hanging over a bed with a duvet lavishly embroidered with the owner’s initials. This sequence shows that Lawler is constantly making connections between various categories of signs, curatorial concerns of private collectors and museums, and the questions raised by redisplaying these pieces as the subject matter of “original” works of art.",6143.0,"Artist

"Tureen in the form of a Rabbit, 1755/56, Chelsea Porcelain Factory","For the rich and powerful in the eighteenth century, formal dinner was theater, and it was not uncommon to serve multiple courses, each of which could consist of dishes arranged on the table. Pieces like the rabbit tureen were an important part of the theatrical set decoration. The Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory produced tureens not only in the form of rabbits but also vegetables and birds. Chelsea porcelain makers prided themselves on the realistic results of their craftsmanship, proclaiming in a sales catalogue that they offered “A Fine tureen in the form of a rabbit as big as life and an oval dish.”Composed of a material called soft-paste porcelain (usually a mixture of clay and ground glass), this tureen has a red anchor mark inside its lid. This mark was used between 1752 and 1756. This particular rabbit tureen is also labeled No. 3, marking it as third in a limited edition—twenty-five variations of this type are known. Like a fingerprint, no two Chelsea rabbit tureens are exactly the same, and each lid was compatible with only its tureen. The painter who decorated the pieces recorded each object’s number on its lid and its base so that they could be matched in case they were separated.",6144.0,"Artist
