"The Lovers, 1490/1500","In the late Middle Ages, domestic spaces contained relatively little furniture, mostly utilitarian chests, cupboards, and benches. Textiles in the form of cushions, bed hangings, and tapestries provided softening elements of warmth and color. Although Flemish and northern French workshops produced monumental tapestry series for princes and cathedrals throughout Europe, in the cities of Basel and Strasbourg, on the upper reaches of the Rhine, weavers specialized in more modest tapestries. They included many woman artisans. Their tapestries featured witty, secular subjects—lovers pledging their faith (as here), fabulous animals, and wild men—and often had a gently moralizing tone, indebted to early engravings produced in the same region.",6151.0,"Title

"Colossal Figure, 1961, Leon Golub","A leading cultural and civil rights activist in the United States from the early 1960s until his death in 2004, Leon Golub consistently created works that addressed humanitarian issues. Colossal Figure suggests the tragic heroes of ancient Greece or Rome––cultures that produced idealized images of clarity, beauty, and strength. This monumental modern counterpart, however, is scarred, vulnerable, and massively imperfect.",6162.0,"Artist

"Wax Anatomical Model with Pretty Face, 1990, Zoe Leonard","Often distinguished by a low-tech, documentary approach, Zoe Leonard’s photographs reveal what is generally forbidden or forgotten. Early in her career, she examined historical images of women. Wax Anatomical Model with Pretty Face—a photograph of a realistic wax female figure (with pubic hair, makeup, and a pearl necklace) whose internal organs are exposed for medical examination—poetically balances visceral fascination with feminist critique. Discovered by the artist at the Museum of Comparative Anatomy in Paris, the figure is clinical in its anatomical precision, but also perversely seductive; Leonard’s depiction juxtaposes desire and horror.",6165.0,"Artist

"Gothic Church Behind an Oak Grove with Tombs, 1810, Karl Friedrich Schinkel","Architect, painter, and printmaker Karl Friedrich Schinkel understood Gothic architecture as a fusion between universal Christianity and German genius. The combination here of vernacular Gothic architecture and a grand oak tree symbolizing Teutonic strength—as well as the medium of lithography itself, which had recently been invented in Munich by Alois Senefelder—infuses the print with a particularly nationalistic significance. This patriotism is all the more pointed given Germany’s military defeat at the hands of Napoleon’s army in 1806 and the subsequent occupation of Schinkel’s home of Berlin by French troops.",6166.0,"Artist

"On the War Trail, Modeled 1921, cast after 1921, Alexander Phimister Proctor","Canadian-born Alexander Phimister Proctor began his career as a sculptor of animals and, along with Edward Kemeys, achieved recognition for the works he created for Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition. During five years of study in France afterward, however, Proctor shifted his interests to large-scale figural studies, particularly of the American West. On the War Trail is a reduced version of a monumental bronze commissioned for the Civic Center in Denver, Colorado. Dignified and erect, with the Native American’s spear thrust defiantly outward, horse and rider provide a striking antidote to the dejected, broken subject of James Earle Fraser’s The End of the Trail(1991.325).",6173.0,"Artist

"Coat of Arms of Maximilian I as King of the Romans, c. 1517, Albrecht Dürer","This double-sided book illustration presents the heraldry of the soon-to-be Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian, Albrecht Dürer’s patron. The chain of stylized flints and firebrands with a dangling sheepskin denotes the Emperor’s membership in the exceedingly prestigious Order of the Golden Fleece, while the central eagles and griffins refer to his various territories. The shield of the author Florian Waldauff appears on the verso, in a woodcut also not by Dürer. Evidently the recto block wore out in the 1500 first edition of the Revelations of Saint Bridget; the 1517 edition replaced Dürer’s very similar design with this entirely new one.",6182.0,"Artist

"Prentice Women’s Hospital, Chicago, Illinois, Perspective, c. 1970, Bertrand Goldberg","For almost 30 years Bertrand Goldberg’s architecture practice focused on hospitals and medical centers, redefining the design of healthcare and research facilities. In the 1960s his experiments in designing the Affiliated Hospitals in Boston and Stanford University Medical Center led to a new form of spatial organization, one that combined rectilinear-base buildings for common services and supplies with geocentric towers for beds and other areas for treating patients. Goldberg arrived at his ideal architectural model in 1971 with the Prentice Women’s Hospital in Chicago, in which a soaring, concrete structure organized patient rooms into floors of radial or village-like clusters to promote efficient nursing care.",6189.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Marthe Marie Tronchin, 1758/61, Jean Etienne Liotard","An admirer of Rosalba Carriera, Liotard evolved a highly personal, realist style that was not well received by the Academicians in Paris, but was welcomed in England, Holland, and his native Geneva. This portrait was made at the height of Liotard’s career in Geneva, during a period (c. 1757-63) in which he portrayed the most politically and intellectually vital individuals in that city. Liotard depicted no less than eight members of the Tronchin family, one of the most important and influential dynasties of the Swiss Republic.",6191.0,"Artist
