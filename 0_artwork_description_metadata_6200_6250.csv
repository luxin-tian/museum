"Fish Mask, Late 19th/early 20th century, Bwa","Among the Bwa, families and lineages have special relationships with nature spirits and ancestors. Such beings are embodied through masquerades that reenact mythic events. In performance, an elderly man carrying a fish net pursues the fish mask shown here. The fish allows the man to capture it, sacrificing itself for the survival of its human counterpart. In contrast, the dwarf mask [see 2000.313] is performed only by the Bondé family and is much smaller in scale than the average Bwa mask. It honors an ancestor who was famed for his knowledge and abilities in the wilderness. As he lay dying, he asked to be remembered with a mask carved to his size.",6201.0,"Culture

"Havana, 1999, Philip-Lorca DiCorcia","Philip-Lorcia diCorcia often orchestrates the production of his images from start to finish. In his series Streetwork (1993–99), however, the artist shifted gears and became, as he put it, ""interested in the dramatic possibilities of chance."" He hid remotely controlled flashes synched to his camera over city streets, leaving one variable undetermined—the subject. Using his camera’s shutter as a trap, diCorcia captured seemingly banal, fleeting moments between strangers on the street. A final addition to Streetwork, Havana is one of 10 photographs that di Corcia took from a single vantage point in this manner, not knowing the situations that might materialize in front of his theatrical lighting. The mute presence of this man pausing on a sidewalk could be interpreted as either inquisitive or predatorial when considered in relation to the two young women at the counter nearby—although diCorcia insists in the ""non-narrative"" quality of his work.",6219.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1980, James Bishop","James Bishop is an American artist who has lived in France since 1958. His exquisitely rendered, relatively rare paintings—which the American poet and art critic John Ashbery once called “part air, part architecture”—combine European and American traditions of postwar art. Bishop’s abstraction is grounded by oblique references to geometry, grids, and architectural structures. In the mid-1960s, he began pouring thinned oil paint onto his canvases and tilting them to layer color without a paintbrush, often leaving areas of white, primed canvas visible to balance such applications of color. Bishop’s paintings are roughly six feet square, reflecting the proportions of his own body.",6220.0,"Artist

"Max Ernst and His Chess Set at the Chess Exhibition, “The Imagery of Chess”, 1945, Unknown","In the summer of 1944, gallery owner Julien Levy, his wife Muriel, and the artist couple Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning rented a house together in Great River, Long Island. While there, they played a prodigious amount of chess. Levy and Ernst, later joined by artist Marcel Duchamp, conceived of an exhibition on the game, and “The Imagery of Chess” opened at Levy’s gallery in December 1944. In this press photograph, Ernst poses with his now–famous wood chess set, shown here in stained boxwood, one of three he made specifically for Levy’s exhibition.",6224.0,"Artist

The other side shows Isis wearing her tall horned headdress and seated on a throne nursing Horus, surrounded by flowers that represent the papyrus marsh in which she sheltered her son.

"Panels from a Funerary Couch (Guanchuang), Northern Wei dynasty (386–535); c. 525","These stone panels were originally assembled to enclose the back and short sides of a low, couchlike platform that held a coffin in a tomb. This “funerary couch” was probably supported along the front and back by two long stone slabs, each elevated on rectangular feet. Such a coffin platform may also have been partially enclosed in front by two stones carved to resemble gate towers, making the couch resemble the walled enclosure of a villa or a city.",6229.0,"Title

"Panels from a Funerary Couch (Guanchuang), Northern Wei dynasty (386–535); c. 525","The original order of the Art Institute stones is not certain. Their present sequence is based on their relative lengths and pictorial compositions as well as on the alignment of the iron hinges. The left and right stones—one including a bullock cart, the other a horse with decorative trappings—may each have formed one short side of the funerary couch. The two stones between them—depicting scenes of figures under canopied platforms or umbrellas (both symbols of high status)—together may have formed the back of this structure. As reconstructed, these scenes present a symmetrical composition that is bracketed at either end by figures facing inward. Such linear drawings in stone enable us to imagine the appearance of early horizontal scroll paintings.",6229.0,"Title

"Panels from a Funerary Couch (Guanchuang), Northern Wei dynasty (386–535); c. 525","Eight framed figural compositions are engraved into the inner surface of these smoothly polished stones. The figures’ proportions and clothing are characteristic of early sixth-century Chinese styles, as known from datable tomb figurines, stone carvings, and rare surviving paintings. Except for the bearded gentlemen and those wearing baggy trousers and small “official” caps, with or without projecting wings, most of these figures seem to depict women. Not all figures, however, can be clearly distinguished as to sex, since long robes with wide collars, high sashes, and flowing sleeves were worn by aristocratic men and women alike, who also shared a hairstyle of upswept side buns. These figures are grouped in stagelike settings—hills, mountains, trees and bushes with decorative foliage patterns, and windblown cloudbands—which suggest what early pictorial landscapes may have looked like.",6229.0,"Title

"The Filatrice (The Spinner), 1850, Henry Kirke Brown","The woman in Henry Kirke Brown’s sculpture holds a distaff in the crook of her right arm, twisting wool or flax into thread and onto a spindle. This classical portrayal of a domestic task evokes the mythic Three Fates, one of whom spins the thread of life. Brown modeled The Filatrice (Italian for “spinner”) in New York and cast it at the foundry he established there in 1848 after his return from Italy. The Filatrice was commissioned by the American Art-Union, an organization that aimed to bring the fine arts to middle-class audiences. Twenty casts were made of the sculpture and distributed to select members by way of lottery.",6230.0,"Artist

"The Execution of Maximilian, 1867–68, Édouard Manet","The young Austrian-born Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph was controversially installed as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in 1864 in an attempt to create a European-style monarchy there, backed by Napoleon III of France and a cohort of monarchists. Seen as part of a European imperialist campaign, Maximilian’s rule was considered illegitimate by those who opposed the French occupation of Mexico. This work interprets the young ruler’s execution in Querétero, Mexico, on June 19, 1867, alongside generals Miguel Miramón (left) and Tomás Mejía (right). Édouard Manet’s composition was inspired by not only history painting and the iconography of Francisco de Goya but also contemporary journalism and the budding field of newspaper photography. One controversial aspect of this print is the presence of French troops in the firing squad rather than those of the Mexican Republic. The lithograph was censored by the French government and was not publicly printed until after Manet’s death.",6232.0,"Artist

"The Pyramid of Gaius Cestius, from Views of Rome, 1750/59, published 1800–07, Giovanni Battista Piranesi","One of two Piranesi engravings of the Pyramid of Cestius, this etching was published posthumously by the artist’s sons. The pyramid was essential viewing for many who undertook the Grand Tour in the 18th and 19th centuries. Constructed c. 18 b.c./c. 12 b.c. as a tomb for the powerful Roman magistrate Gaius Cestius, the marble-clad structure is reminiscent of the Roman fad for all things Egyptian. In fact, the similarity of the tomb to the pyramids of Nubia suggests that Cestius served on a military campaign in Egypt. Today Cestius’s well-preserved tomb remains Rome’s only existing ancient Egyptian-style pyramid.",6238.0,"Artist

"Bottle, Late 19th/early 20th century, Ambundu","Often highly inventive in their forms, small bottles are made by potters throughout Central Africa for holding liquids such as beer, oil, water, or palm wine.
