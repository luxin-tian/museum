"Blindfold, 2002, Anri Sala","Anri Sala has received extraordinary acclaim for a series of unconventionally beautiful, politically inflected videos. A global itinerant, he lives and works all over the world—predominantly in Berlin and formerly in Paris and his native Tirana. The artist’s short, formally accomplished works poignantly and strategically blend documentary, narrative, and autobiographical approaches, existing as minimal, ab-stract allegories of cultural suspension and transition. Concerns of immigration, exile, social alienation, violence, crime, poverty, and repression shadow all of his poetic, melancholic compositions.
Sala’s work is rooted in part in Albanian culture and history. He grew up under one of the most repressive communist dictatorships in Europe and later witnessed the tentative transition to a democratic, market-driven system before leaving to study in France in 1996. The following year, the Albanian economy collapsed under the weight of a corrupt government, bringing widespread lawlessness and violent unrest. Sala’s intensely analytical perspective has been forged by this firsthand experience of social turbulence and radical change. Confronting a traumatic history while negotiating a diasporic present, his work describes a condition of simultaneous disorientations—temporal, spatial, visual, aural, and linguistic.
Blindfold, like Sala’s work in general, displays an acute political consciousness. The two-channel projection depicts a blinding sun. Shown both at sunrise and sunset, it reflects off a pair of new, as-yet-unused metal billboards in Tirana, a city that figures prominently in many of Sala’s mature experiments. The radiant blankness of the two boards, which appear as surrogate cinema screens, suggests the incipient, fragile nature of Albania’s transition to a capitalist economy. The infrastructure of shiny public advertising coexists incongruously with the city’s decrepit surroundings.",6252.0,"Artist

"In Other Folk’s Homes, from The Black Woman (formerly The Negro Woman) (published 1946-47), 1946, printed 1989, Elizabeth Catlett","The I Am the Black Woman series (previously called Negro Women) is composed of 15 linocuts accompanied by explanatory titles and texts. The series celebrates the courage and determination of female heroines of African American history, as well as the valor, integrity, and resolve of ordinary women. The Art Institute’s three prints from the series focus on the daily struggles of African American women. Aesthetically, the entire series is characterized by an emphasis on figural simplicity. A palpable sense of movement and a lack of excessive detail are visible throughout the series. This print, In Other Folks’ Homes, politicizes the everyday by highlighting the plight of domestic workers.",6256.0,"Artist

"Snake Headdress (a-Mantsho-ña-Tshol or Inap), Late 19th/early 20th century, Baga","The performance of the snake headdress required extraordinary strength and balance. With the headdress lashed to a conical framework of palm branches and balanced atop the head, the dancer performed sharp, quick movements; he dipped and rotated the sculpture by bending at the knees and turning at the waist. The snake is associated with the swamp-dwelling boa constrictor spirit, who blesses humankind with rain, fertility, and wealth. Snake headdress performances were widespread until the mid-1950s, when Islamic revolutionaries led a campaign to consolidate the religious and national identity of the nascent Republic of Guinea.",6259.0,"Culture

"Titian and His Mistress, c. 1620, Anthony van Dyck","Anthony van Dyck’s print of a lost self-portrait by the Venetian master Titian shows the artist with a luxuriously dressed woman who is significantly younger than he is. Included within the work is a popular Venetian verse that comments on the woman’s beauty and declares that she is expecting a child, while calling Titian “great” and praising his artistic skill. The woman’s arm rests on a box containing a skull, and her eyes look away from the aged Titian, indicating the artist’s mortality and man’s inevitable decline into old age. The master reaches out to touch the abdomen of the young, sumptuous woman, contrasting himself with the new life of her unborn child.",6265.0,"Artist

"Large Luster Bowl, Seljuq dynasty (1037–1194), 12th century, dated 1191 (Safar, 587 A.H.)","This fragmented bowl combines two different luster styles in a single object. The vessel is primarily decorated in the miniature technique, so-called for its similarities to miniature or manuscript painting. The horizontal bands of the design, the checkerboard trees, and the white background are all hallmarks of this type of decoration. However, some of the figures are painted in reserve, with their forms in white and the surrounding pattern filled in around them—a feature more typical of the monumental style of luster painting.This luster bowl also contains two different bands of inscriptions. An inscription derived from knotted Kufic with dense arabesques surrounds the interior rim and repeats a single word, wealth. The other inscription lines the exterior rim of the bowl and contains the date of creation, an illegible signature, and lines from Persian poetry, which do not relate directly to the imagery of the bowl’s decoration. Some of the poetry is indecipherable, but two couplets have been identified as part of an ode written by the known Persian poet, Sana’i Ghaznavi.",6270.0,"Title

"Stéphane Mallarmé, 1897, Edvard Munch","Stéphane Mallarmé is today considered one of France’s most important poets of the second half of the nineteenth century. Although he was known for the obscure imagery and difficult syntax of his verse, Mallarmé enjoyed the friendship of other modern thinkers, in particular, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists such as Édouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Odilon Redon, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, and James McNeill Whistler. Despite the fact that much of his poetry is unabashedly extreme and difficult to decipher, artists continue, to this day, to turn to his evocative verse for inspiration.",6274.0,"Artist

"Stéphane Mallarmé, 1897, Edvard Munch","Edvard Munch met Mallarmé during a trip to Paris in 1896–97, and he became a regular guest at Mallarmé’s Tuesday night soirees, where he mingled with other visionaries of the day such as August Strindberg and Vincent van Gogh. In this portrait, Munch depicted the poet as a disembodied head, floating almost mystically. The use of green ink recalls the faded green accouterments of Mallarmé’s study. Of this portrait Munch said, “I drew him in half-shadow which matched his character.” Though it is not known whether this was a commissioned portrait, it might have been intended for the frontispiece of an edition of the complete works of Mallarmé, published in 1897. The project ultimately failed because Munch worked too slowly. Regardless of that disappointment, Mallarmé was pleased with the final print and described it as a “gripping portrait, which gives me an intimate sense of myself.”",6274.0,"Artist

"Library Table, 1896, Frank Lloyd Wright","Like his Prairie School contemporaries, Frank Lloyd Wright drew upon the ideas of the English Arts and Crafts movement in formulating his own principles of architecture and design, beliefs that included an adherence to simplicity in design, a preference for straightforward construction methods, and the use of plain, high-quality materials. This library table, designed by Wright for the remodeling of the Charles E. Roberts House, contains the strong balance of horizontality and verticality characteristic of the Prairie School while accentuating the rich oak surface. Wright championed the importance of machinery to improve design; although this table is indebted to industrial production methods, the beading on the door suggests the hand of the craftsman.",6282.0,"Artist

"Pan of Rohallion, Modeled 1890, cast after 1894, Frederick William MacMonnies","Born in Brooklyn, Frederick William MacMonnies was one of the preeminent American sculptors of the late 19th century. Studying in New York, Munich, and Paris, MacMonnies lived most of his productive professional life in France. From his European studio, he executed public and private commissions for patrons in the U.S. With the assistance of architect Stanford White, MacMonnies earned the assignment for Pan of Rohallion, designed as a fountain figure for a garden pool on a private estate in New Jersey. The estate was called Rohallion in honor of a place of same name in the patron’s native Scotland. MacMonnies’s sculpture, with its classical theme and compositional clarity, held wide appeal and was later sold in reduced versions such as this example.",6296.0,"Artist
