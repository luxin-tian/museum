"The Trojan Horse Being Dragged into the City of Troy, 1545, Giulio di Antonio Bonasone","The source of this engraving was a design by Francesco Primaticcio, an Italian Mannerist who worked at Fountainebleu. It represents a scene from the Trojan War, which was recounted in the Aeneid, an epic by Virgil. The Trojans found a wooden horse that had been left as an offering to their gods outside the gates of Troy. Thinking that after 10 years the Greeks must surely have lifted their siege of the city and departed, the Trojans decided that it was safe to bring the horse into the city. However, that night the Greek soldiers who had hidden themselves inside the horse opened the gates for their compatriots and invaded Troy.",6315.0,"Artist

"Alicante, Spain, 1933, printed 1930/39, Henri Cartier-Bresson","Henri Cartier-Bresson became known for “the decisive moment,” an instantaneous composition of a scene, for which the photographer must act quickly and intuitively. As a photojournalist for Magnum Photos, the agency he founded with his colleagues Robert Capa and David “Chim” Seymour, he traveled across the world, photographing some of the most important events of the 20th century. Early in his career, he developed a distinct style of photography and made some of his most famous and enduring images.",6319.0,"Artist

"Fragment of a Kneeling Figure, 11th/14th century, Niger Delta","Little is known about the meaning and function of the terracotta figures discovered in various sites around the abandoned city of Jenné-Jeno in modern Mali. Archaeological excavations revealed that figures like this partial example were set into the walls and foundations of buildings, suggesting they served a religious purpose. The loincloth and stack of bracelets on this figure indicated high social rank. The snakes wrapping around his torso are common in the iconography of the Inland Niger Delta and undoubtedly had symbolic significance.",6323.0,"Culture

"The Wounded Goetz Cared for by the Bohemians, 1836, Eugène Delacroix","Drawing inspiration from literature and theater, Eugène Delacroix developed a long-standing interest in the writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832). He completed a series of prints based on the famous Faust and seven lithographs, including this one, from Goetz of Berlichingen. Goetz’s reputation as a noble knight spread so far that even the gypsies declared their loyalty to him and provided him with aid. Goethe highly praised Delacroix’s interpretations of scenes from his plays, such as this one.",6327.0,"Artist

"Heads and Paws of Lions, n.d., Eugène Delacroix","While Delacroix never completed classical academy training, the practice of drawing from three-dimensional sculptural fragments stayed with him. He sketched details for future paintings like these from live caged animals as well as from dissected cadavers. Delacroix’s friend and fellow artist Antoine-Louis Barye even used casts of animal parts for his monochrome bronzes. In contrast, Delacroix’s touches of color increase the liveliness of these isolated images.",6329.0,"Artist

"Highrise Buildings Sketch, Chicago, Illinois, Perspective Sketches, c. 1946–1948, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe","Mies van der Rohe realized many influential tall buildings and is widely credited with establishing a minimalist design template for rectangular towers in steel-and-glass office buildings in American cities throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Mies’ first realized towers, however, were a series of residential buildings in Chicago, the most famous of which is 860–880 Lake Shore Drive, completed in 1951. With an economy of line, this sketch for two high-rise buildings illustrates the dynamic, perpendicular relationship of the 860– 880 towers, as well as the uniform columns supporting the buildings’ volumes at ground level, creating a joined arcade and lobbies for the apartments.",6331.0,"Artist

"The Invisible Man (Harlem, New York), 1952, Gordon Parks","In 1952 Gordon Parks—at the time the only African American staff photographer at Life magazine—brought an actor into the streets of Harlem to create a series on Ralph Ellison’s new novel Invisible Man, which had been immediately hailed as a breakthrough representation of black experience in America. The book’s narrator describes living “rent-free in a building rented strictly to whites, in a section of the basement that was shut off and forgotten during the nineteenth century.” To illustrate this scene, Parks set his camera on the pavement to take the picture, then burned (darkened) the top and bottom of the print, producing an expressive glow around the man’s face. The series, published in the August 25, 1952, issue of Life, illustrated a fiction but also informed millions across America and abroad about everyday life in Harlem. This rare early print was circulated in a show mounted by the American Federation of the Arts in 1962–65.",6338.0,"Artist

"Pedestrians on Brooklyn Bridge, 1920/29, John Marin","The upward thrust of the Brooklyn Bridge’s two Gothic arches and the powerful pull exerted by its network of high-tension cables, depicted so effectively in this taut drawing, embodied Marin’s concept of weights and balances. Formally, the great bridge also offered a framing device for the skyline and challenged the artist’s long-standing interest in linear systems.",6340.0,"Artist

"The Betrayal, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",6342.0,"Artist

"Okavango Delta Spa, Botswana, Rendering, 1997, ROY","The concept for this commission for a Botswana spa was to merge the world of the sophisticated traveler with the bush experience. The pods (pavilions) collectively evoke a provisional setting. Each unit’s enclosure comprises a low deck with a massage table and chair, a slightly raised area for sleeping, and a tethered fiberglass bathroom unit. Below the water level is an infrastructure that allows the site’s overall structures to function. Above water level is a more topographical composition of elements, such as curvilinear walkways that are tethered to abandoned termite mounds leading to the individual pods.",6347.0,"Artist
