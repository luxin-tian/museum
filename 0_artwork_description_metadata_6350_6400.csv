"Dish (Tabaq) with Scale Pattern and Serrated Leaves, Ottoman dynasty (1299–1923), late 16th century, Islamic","The central design of this dish features two opposing leaves surrounding a central three-lobed (trefoil) shape, all set against a fish-scale motif in turquoise and blue. The design of the leaves is in the so-called saz (reed) style, referring to the reed pen used by Persian and Turkish artists to create black-ink drawings. Early drawings in this style depict dragons and phoenixes in combat surrounded by blossoms and feather-like leaves. The rim of the vessel contains a classic ""wave and rock"" pattern, inspired by Chinese ceramics. At the beginning of Iznik pottery production, Chinese porcelain exerted a large influence on the style and colors of Iznik tiles. However, by the late 16th century, when this dish was created, Iznik potters had developed their own distinctive style of colorful floral and abstract motifs that went beyond their original Chinese influence.",6355.0,"Culture

"Tertradrachm (Coin) Portraying Alexander the Great as Herakles, 336/323 BC, Ancient Greek","The purpose of the first portrait coins was to identify the ruler. The front side became a mirror of the sovereign’s self-image. The back was often used to communicate the ruler’s accomplishments or intentions. The profile portrait was used because it suited the very shallow depth and limited surface of the coin. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how modern coins are created today.",6359.0,"Culture

"Tertradrachm (Coin) Portraying Alexander the Great as Herakles, 336/323 BC, Ancient Greek","As Alexander the Great (ruled 336–323 BC) swept across the Persian Empire, conquering kingdoms from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indus River, he paid his army with coins that portrayed him as he wished to be seen: youthful and clean-shaven with hair tousled and eyes cast skyward. The image became the model for subsequent royal portraiture.",6359.0,"Culture

"La Madrilenita, 1910, Robert Henri","Robert Henri dedicated his career to painting portraits of those he called “my people,” namely, sitters who evoked a personal response in the artist. He found many appealing subjects while traveling in Spain, including matadors and picadors, gypsies, dressmakers, and performers. Henri admired the subject of La Madrileñita, a 15-year-old dancer named Josefa Cruz, for her talent and traditional training, as he later recalled: “Although very young she was already a very remarkable dancer at the time the painting was done, and it seemed to me that she had in her carriage … much of the spirit and dignity of old Spain.” Henri painted six
portraits of Cruz; in this version, completed over the course of two days, she turns her head to look over her shoulder, directly engaging the viewer in a poised and assured manner. Her enigmatic smile bears a sense of mystery that is heightened by the darkness beyond.",6368.0,"Artist

"Study for Holograms, 1970, Bruce Nauman","Derived from one of a series of photographs, this screenprint depicts the lower half of the artist’s face with exaggerated expressions. The focus is the subject’s mouth and its transformation by squeezing, stretching, and pulling. The performative imagery convey the body as a plastic form that can be manipulated. Fundamentally arbitrary, the facial gestures are expected to evoke an emotional response from the viewer. After photographing the faces, Nauman filmed them. He eventually decided to translate them into holograms, since he felt that the medium more suitably captured their sculptural form and meaning.",6374.0,"Artist

"A Game in Hell: A Poem (Igra v adu: Poema), 1912, Natalia Goncharova","These recently acquired books by progressive Russian artists and poets, made between the revolutions of 1905 and 1917, aimed to overthrow conventions of art and society simultaneously. Their makers believed that art and language needed to become immediate and real—part of everyday life—and as a result these Futurist books were willfully made with cheap materials, and appeared purposely unrefined, as if they were products of wild and primitive behavior.",6397.0,"Artist

"Abraham Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois, June 3, 1860, printed c. 1880, Alexander Hesler","Alexander Hesler, a noted commercial photographer based in Chicago, arranged two portrait sessions with Lincoln, in 1858 and 1860. The images from their first session displayed the presidential candidate with disordered and messy hair. During the subsequent election campaign, the Republican National Committee grew concerned that Lincoln might appear unkempt compared to his opponent, Stephen A. Douglas. Hesler therefore produced this more dapper and well-groomed representation of the candidate at the second sitting, and these and similar portraits by Mathew Brady were widely distributed as badges. In this first presidential campaign to employ photographs, the decision to make Lincoln a familiar face may well have swayed voters. The artist George B. Ayers purchased Hesler’s studio in 1867, a move that saved its contents from being destroyed when the gallery burned down in the Chicago Fire of 1871. Ayers later reprinted Hesler’s glass plate negatives, claiming this image in particular as the ""Original and Best Picture of Abraham Lincoln,"" essential for any collector of portraits or Lincoln memorabilia.",6399.0,"Artist
