"Bathing of the Buddha Festival, Qing dynasty, 1833, Hua Ziyou","This affable and remarkably zany cast of characters plays upon the festive atmosphere of an annual celebration held to commemorate the birth of the historical Buddha and his first shower by water-bearing dragons. Some of the disciples pictured flaunt pseudo-religious “miracles”: one opens his stomach to reveal the Buddha nature within and another magically creates a temple in mid-air. Other disciples nonchalantly engage on superficially mundane activities that allude to Buddhist conduct, such as mending clothes and reading sutras. A lion, elephant, tiger, dragon, and phoenix are also in attendance; some serve as traditional vehicles of Buddhist deities, whereas others are more generally auspicious. Together, these personalities exude the vitality of a secularized but nonetheless sincere faith.",6404.0,"Artist

"Slant-Front Desk, c. 1720, Heinrich Ludwig Rohde","The marquetry incorporates varieties of wood that would have been readily available in Germany, like maple, walnut, spruce, and oak, as well as costly imported materials like mahogany and amaranth. They are finely pieced together in geometric and naturalistic patterns; at the center of the fall front is a salamander, a creature able reputed by myth to be invulnerable to fire. An unusual motif, it probably held some kind of significance for the desk’s original owner.",6413.0,"Artist

"Saint Sebastian, 1500/10, Nicoletto da Modena","Nicoletto da Modena is best known for his idiosyncratic prints and engravings. His works are rendered in a style characterized by delicate cross-hatching and purity of line, with some similarity to the Ferrarese Tarocchi cards. Here the martyr Saint Sebastian is lashed rather serenely to a decorative column in a landscape setting with ancient ruins. Nicoletto often used a burr to produce the decorated surface effects, best seen in the darker areas of the ceiling architecture.",6422.0,"Artist

Sullivan","In 1922 a small group of friends and colleagues worked with Art Institute staff to commission Louis Sullivan to produce a series of drawings illustrating his philosophy of architec- tural ornament. Completed in the last year of his life, this project—an essay and 20 detailed plates—outlines Sullivan’s belief that ornament was the consummate expression of a designer’s intellect and creative freedom. These ideas greatly influenced the next generation of architects in Chicago, and the publication is now recognized as one of the most important statements on modern architecture.",6424.0,"Artist

"Posada in His Workshop (Homage to Posada), 1953, Leopoldo Méndez","Leopoldo Méndez was a cofounder of the Taller de Gráfica Popular, its ostensible leader and premier printmaker. This large-scale linocut is a technical tour de force and one of the key works in his oeuvre. It depicts José Guadalupe Posada, the turn-of-the-century broadside illustrator, as an artisan-revolutionary and summarizes the critical example of Posada to the Taller as a creator of popular, socially conscious art. This idealized image shows Posada at work, burin in hand, preparing a plate through laborious hand engraving. He contemplates a scene of violence outside his window, representative of the abusive regime of dictator Porfirio Díaz. Waiting expectantly behind Posada are his printer and the Flores Magón brothers, two early Mexican revolutionary thinkers, one of whom holds a tract denouncing the practice of conscripted labor. Méndez inscribed his own birth date, 1902, in the calendar banner above Posada’s head, further underscoring the image’s construction of artistic and political lineages.",6432.0,"Artist

Leopoldo Méndez fue cofundador del Taller de Gráfica Popular, su líder indiscutible y principal grabador. Este linograbado de gran formato es una hazaña técnica y una de las obras clave de Méndez. En él se muestra a José Guadalupe Posada, el ilustrador de hojas volantes del previo cambio de siglo, como artesano y revolucionario. La imagen resume la visión que tenía el Taller de Posada como ejemplo a seguir para la producción de un arte popular y socialmente consciente. Se trata de una imagen idealizada en la que Posada aparece con su buril preparando una lámina mediante el laborioso tallado manual, mientras observa por la ventana una escena de violencia a manos de la dictadura de Porfirio Díaz. Detrás de Posada, expectantes, se encuentran su cajista y los hermanos Flores Magón, dos importantes pensadores revolucionarios. Uno de ellos sostiene un documento que denuncia la práctica del trabajo forzado. Méndez incluyó el año de su nacimiento (1902) en el calendario detrás de Posada con lo que se subraya aún más la declaración de linajes artísticos y políticos de la imagen.",6432.0,"Artist

"Madame du Barry, 1771, Jean Baptiste André Gautier d’Agoty","The artists of the Gautier D’Agosty family experimented with several approaches to color printing. In the attempt to make what they called “printed paintings”, they sometimes even varnished their final results. This aquatint is not only printed in full color from multiple plates, but the lace bordering Madam du Barry’s negligée has been deeply embossed in a painterly impasto manner. The accompanying poem suggest fawningly that this royal mistress in her boudoir is indistinguishable from Venus, the goddess of love.",6434.0,"Artist

"Stamnos (Mixing Jar), 480/470 BC, Copenhagen Painter","This stamnos allows us a glimpse into ancient and modern conservation practices. On one handle, two holes are visible, evidence of an ancient repair. More recently, when the adhesive that held this vessel together began to deteriorate, the object was completely disassembled. However, in the midst of taking it apart, conservators discovered that the jar was actually composed of parts from several other ancient ceramics, most notably, in the areas of the neck and foot. These pieces had been sanded to fit together and painted to unify the surface. In many cases, mismatched vessels languished in storage. Here, however, the conservators decided to reassemble the vase, put it on display, and tell its story. To do so, the conservator used a reversible adhesive to piece it back together, and then filled in the lost areas with plaster and painted them matte black so they are readily distinguishable from the ancient parts.",6438.0,"Artist

"Back View of Standing Male Nude, c. 1873–77, Sir Edward Burne-Jones","Life drawing from the nude was an integral part of the rigorous academic training an artist might traditionally receive in Paris and other major cities in the 19th century. Only after beginning with rote copying from prints and plaster casts after the antique would qualified, usually male, students progress to the nude model. The highly finished drawings that resulted from these sessions hearken back to Classical sculpture in their definition of relief and generally demonstrate more the respective technical aptitude of these young artists than their creative potential. Paul Cézanne and Gustav Klimt’s nudes are particularly difficult to recognize as autograph, although they underline the dramatic journey made by these artists to their mature styles. Luminous in surface handling and a tendency toward allegory, Edward Burne-Jones’ sketchbook nudes are less rigorous in their anatomical detail, while Auguste Rodin’s cropped female form floats across the page as an ode to the theme of eternal feminine. Conversely, the subject of Gustave Courbet’s Model Reading exhibits partial undress rather than complete nudity in a moment of quiet introspection between her modeling sessions.",6439.0,"Artist

"Back View of Standing Male Nude, c. 1873–77, Sir Edward Burne-Jones","The diminishing influence of the Academy, and its advocacy of realistic painting, infused a short-lived periodical, Le nu esthètique (The aesthetic nude). Produced shortly after the emergence of photography helped nudge painting toward greater abstraction, this publication offered decoratively laid-out photographs of female, male, and child nudes in varying poses and allegorical guises, purportedly for artists to study from life. No corresponding paintings are known, but the ultimate academician Jean-Léon Gerôme’s introduction suggests its audience was intended to be a new generation of academic painters.",6439.0,"Artist
