"Cinerary Urn, Late 1st/early 2nd century AD, Ancient Roman","This cinerary urn likely held the cremated remains of two individuals, presumably a husband and wife. The lid features portraits of the deceased flanked by symbols of the Roman goddess of love, Venus (the Greek Aphrodite), including dolphins and winged erotes, the goddess’s mythological companions. The front of the urn contains two rectangular panels, which were intended for personalized inscriptions but were instead left blank. Surrounding the panels are garland swags and an ox skull, both motifs associated with sacrificial rites, as well as rabbits, symbols of love and immortality.",6453.0,"Culture

"Buddhist Water Sprinkler (Kundika), Tang dynasty (618–907), 7th century","This type of vase with pouring spout and tubelike mouth at the shoulder has served several roles in Buddhist ritual: to purify a sacred space, to invoke a deity, or to anoint a worshipper. Created in bronze as well as several types of stoneware, these vessels originated in India and spread throughout East and Southeast Asia. In Chinese Buddhist art, the kundika appears primarily as an attribute of the bodhisattva Guanyin (Sanskrit: Avalokitesvara). This ceramic example may have been made primarily for burial.",6459.0,"Title

"The Greatest Love of Don Juan, 1879, Félicien Rops","Paris was the undisputed artistic and cultural capital of Europe in the late 19th century; it was also home to a thriving population of prostitutes. As Hollis Clayson observed in her study of prostitution and French art, Painted Love, artists of the period, particularly the Impressionists, enthusiastically embraced the activities of these women through varying degrees of realistic imagery. The increasingly abstract depictions of prostitutes’ everyday pursuits, from bathing to entertaining clients, possessed a risky, modern, and voyeuristic flair. Artists also capitalized on the ambiguity of their subjects’ profession, as many of these women moved fluidly between being a dancer, actress, courtesan, brothel resident, street prostitute, or some combination thereof.",6464.0,"Artist

"The Greatest Love of Don Juan, 1879, Félicien Rops","While Édouard Manet’s print Olympia, which reinterpreted the controversial painting of the same name (Musée d’Orsay, Paris), implies an expensive sexual transaction by emphasizing its subject’s nudity through the contrast of monochrome crosshatched lines and blank fleshy areas, Edgar Degas depicted the high-class brothel in frankly observed yet lushly colorful pastels over monotype. These works deftly reflect the inverse correlation between the amount of clothing worn by the women and the asking price for their services. On the other hand, lower-class working women were expected to be more completely dressed as well as unemotional in carrying out their perfunctory duties, as seen in Albert Bertrand’s shadowed, cleavage-proffering Street Walker. The provocatively bared buttocks and infantalizing pigtails in Félicien Rops and Jean Louis Forain’s prints underscore the expensive preference for presumed virgins in many of the most refined brothels. These deluxe establishments would double their earnings in 1878 during the Paris Exposition Universelle.",6464.0,"Artist

"Royal Chair (Akonkromfi), Probably mid–/late 19th century, Asante","At the height of Asante power in the 18th and 19th centuries, a wide variety of decorative seats, ranging from stools to chairs and palanquins, were developed as symbols of rulership. The wooden frame of this akonkromfi chair is covered with brass knobs, tacks, and decorative repousséd sheeting. Akonkromfi means “praying mantis,” a reference to the chair’s crossed legs, which are derived from a European folding-chair prototype. Akonkromfi are mainly reserved for festive occasions, when they may be carried alongside a chief in procession or used to support the stool that is the ultimate symbol of his divinely sanctioned power.",6467.0,"Culture

"Reading, 1822, Pierre Paul Prud’hon","Many artists viewed lithography as a tool that would allow them to reproduce paintings and spread their fame. In contrast, Pierre-Paul Prud’hon was an artist who created prints as unique works of art. Working in the period following the French Revolution, his embrace of sensual and classical allegorical figures was initially at odds with the prevailing patriotic and military mood in France. However, the escapist quality of his prints soon gained popularity and fame.",6468.0,"Artist

"Woman’s Hat (Isicholo), 20th century, Northern Nguni","In many African cultures, hats represent an extension of traditional hairstyles and can signify cultural, social, and personal meanings. The form of the isicholo, or married woman’s hat, developed out of a 19th-century conical hairstyle that was worn as a sign of respect to one’s husband and his family, in addition to serving as a public symbol of married status. In the early 20th century, a removable hat like this one replaced the hairstyle. This hat, with its flaring disk-like shape, is constructed of human hair. The reddish hue—associated with beauty and femininity—is the result of the application of a red ocher and fat mixture colorant.",6480.0,"Culture

"Lekythos (Oil Jar), About 440 BC, Ancient Greek","Athenian cemeteries housed a variety of monuments and offerings to the dead. This terracotta vessel, called a lekythos, is one example that held oil. From the middle until the end of the fifth century B.C., they were usually decorated in a distinctive technique known as white ground, so called after the light slip coating on the body and shoulder of the vase. Atop this, figures were usually drawn in outline and then painted in rich colors, many of which have since faded. Since most of these bottles were made for burial with the dead or to be left at their graves, the scenes on their surfaces typically represent tombs, visitors to tombs, and farewell scenes.",6484.0,"Culture

"Lekythos (Oil Jar), About 440 BC, Ancient Greek","A woman drawn in outline stands beside an empty chair. Presumably it references the absence of a loved one. A basket sits on the ground behind her. There are no remains of color. Unrelated to the scene but of interest in its own right is the inscription extending before the woman. It states that a youth by the name of Euaion is handsome. The subject of this praise is probably the son of the great Athenian dramatist Aeschylus (525–456 BC). Like his father, Euaion became a tragedian.",6484.0,"Culture

"Headdress for Gelede (Igi), Early/mid–20th century, Yoruba","This wooden mask, which would have been worn over the head like a helmet, is a superb example of an art form that is found almost exclusively among the Egbado, a subgroup inhabiting the northwestern part of Yourubaland. A gelede is a festival of masks performed in veneration of the society’s powerful older women, the iyami. Egbado Yoruba communities perform gelede annually, at which time they formally recognize the powers of the iyami, and solicit their benevolence to ensure the prosperity of the community.
This mask is typical of what Western museums and galleries display to represent gelede. The actual festival involves street orchestras, a lavish display of wooden and cloth costumes, dance, music, singing, and drama that are designed to entertain the viewers, who are also integrated into the performances. The wooden helmet at the top of the masked dancer’s head is part of a large, mixed-media ensemble, including fabric, beads, seeds, and bones, as well as other sculptural pieces attached to various parts of the masked dancer’s body. This gelede mask represents the outsider, who can be a foreigner or a Yoruba who does not adhere to the cultural norm. Outsider status is indicated by the oblique facial mark across the nose, called baamu. The headgear resembles a stylish type of hat, with two overhanging flaps, called abetiaja, meaning the ears of a dog. These flaps may also represent the wings of birds, which the Yoruba associate with women. The calm look on the mask reflects the cool character of elderly females, who are thought to conceal their power under a cloak of humility, patience, care, and obliviousness.",6485.0,"Culture

"Flight Patterns, 2011, Aaron Koblin","Flight Patterns is a time-lapse animation that employs data visualization and processing, an open-source computer programming environment, in order to display American air-traffic patterns and densities over a twenty-four-hour period. Begun as a larger project at UCLA with designers Scott Hessels and Gabriel Dunne, Aaron Koblin’s animations follow the routes of 140,000 airplanes crossing the United States beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time. Koblin uses variations of color and pattern to illustrate a wide range of data and events, including aircraft type, alterations to routes, changes in flight traffic over certain geographical areas, weather systems, and no-fly zones. As the animation reveals multiple iterations of flight patterns during the cycle, the viewer experiences a changing, phantom geography of the country with airline hubs appearing as bright points of diffusion within a complex web.",6498.0,"Artist
