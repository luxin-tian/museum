"Clytie, 1868, George Frederick Watts","Clytie, a Greek water nymph, was turned into a sunflower by the gods. The Victorian sculptor George Frederick Watts used this subject as a meditation on transformation, blending male and female elements in this bust, much as Michelangelo had done in his sculptures. Watts’s composite approach gives the work a powerful and experimental quality, which is enhanced by the presence of mold marks. Plaster casts were made from piece molds that left mold lines after casting. Normally these would have been smoothed away, but Watts chose to leave them here. The presence of these lines in the cast invites comparison with bronzes by Watts’s younger contemporary Auguste Rodin, in which mold lines are also preserved.",6515.0,"Artist

"Dish with Europeans Playing Musical Instruments, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Kangxi period (1661–1722)","The design of musicians in the center of this dish is based on a print of a French “costume party” designed by French engravers. One possible source is the engraving titled Symphonie du Tympanum, du Luth et de la Flut d’Allemagne [Symphony of Dulcimer, Lute, and German Flute] by Nicholas Bonnart (1646-1718) and Robert Bonnart (1652-after 1686). Chinese porcelains decorated with such images reflected prevailing European fashion for masquerades and were generally commissioned for export to France, Italy, and Holland. As characteristic of many export wares ordered and shipped abroad by maritime companies and private traders, the panels of Chinese landscape encircling this French image create a truly multicultural composition.",6517.0,"Title

"Newsies at Skeeter Branch, St. Louis, Missouri, 11:00 a.m., May 9, 1910, Lewis Wickes Hine","Beginning in 1906, Lewis Hine was employed by the National Child Labor Committee to photograph and investigate scenes of child labor across the country. He produced some five thousand images of deplorable working and living conditions for children—some just four or five years old—in coal mines, cotton mills, canneries, and farms, sometimes posing as a fire inspector or postcard salesman to gain access. Hine composed his images to elicit sympathy from viewers, adding captions noting his subjects’ ages, heights, or work histories. Interested in art as a means to enhance persuasion and critical thinking rather than to create things of rarefied beauty, Hine distributed his photographs in reformist or popular magazines; they were also made into graphic posters and employed as lantern slides in lectures. It was relatively hard to inspire compassion for those in the “street trades,” especially newspaper delivery boys (newsies), whom contemporary literature both valorized and sentimentalized. The committee, however, demonstrated that in no other occupation were children so unsupervised and that the harsh city environment exposed them to physical danger and adult vices. The young boys seen here, smoking like their elders, seem prematurely hardened to life on the street.",6537.0,"Artist

"Psyche’s Entrance into Cupid’s Palace [left fragment], from The Story of Psyche, 1756/63, François Boucher","Once the left and right parts of a larger hanging from a Story of Psyche series, these two tapestries portray the musicians and serving maids who welcomed the mortal Psyche, a beautiful young virgin, upon her chance arrival at the palace of the god Cupid. According to the version of the ancient Roman fable recorded in Lucius Apuleius’s second-century book The Golden Ass, Cupid and Psyche fell in love. The god visited her only at night so she would not learn his divine identity. One night Psyche was unable to restrain her curiosity and glimpsed Cupid’s face. She was banished for her disobedience but eventually recovered Cupid’s trust and love. Psyche’s story—with its characteristically human themes of loneliness, loss, despair, hope, and love—was already a popular subject when the cartoons for this series were commissioned on behalf of Louis XV (r. 1715–74) from the royal tapestry manufactory at Beauvais.",6547.0,"Artist
