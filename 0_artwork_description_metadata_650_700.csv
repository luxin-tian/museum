"Auvers, Panoramic View, 1873/75, Paul Cézanne","Paul Cézanne painted this work during his first prolonged stay at Auvers, where the older Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro was his companion and mentor. He chose to focus not on a notable, picturesque site—the Oise River or the medieval church of Notre-Dame—but rather on the patchwork formed by the town’s ordinary houses and rooftops. The tall white structure with a single window on the left of the composition is the house of Dr. Paul Gachet, a friend and collector of the Impressionists and the painting’s first owner.",657.0,"Artist

"Stamnos (Mixing Jar), about 450 BC, Chicago Painter","This refined Athenian stamnos (pl. stamnoi) was used to mix water and wine. Also valued for its beauty, this red-figure vessel (so called because the figures remain the natural color of the clay) portrays either Greek women or maenads, female participants in rites celebrating Dionysos, the god of wine. But unlike the frenzied and whirling figures of other Greek vases, these women convey calm, even elegance. This tender serenity, coupled with a softer, somewhat freer form, is a hallmark of the artist (referred to as the Chicago Painter because of this vase) and has been used to identify other works by him, principally similar stamnoi. Working in the potters’ quarter of mid-fifth-century BC Athens, the painter was active during the construction of the Parthenon, the stylistic influence of which can be seen here. He worked closely with a master potter whose vases were individually shaped in a prescribed range of configurations. With refined designs that are gracefully adapted to its shape, this stamnos is a fine example of red-figure painting during the Classical era. It retains its original lid, a rarity among ancient vases.",659.0,"Artist

"Girl with Cat, 1937, Balthus","Balthus’s legendary secretiveness has inhibited critical commentary on his paintings. His son Stanislas appears at times to have been his spokesman, arguing that the girls in his father’s paintings are ""emblematic archetypes… their very youth the symbol of an ageless body of glory, as adolescence (from the Latin adolescere: to grow toward) aptly symbolizes that heavenward state of growth which Plato refers to in the Timaeus"" (Klossowski de Rola 1983, p. 10). He also suggested, a little more plausibly, that the paintings emphasize the act of seeing, though unfortunately he used this as an excuse to propose that an ideal state can be achieved from their contemplation ""wherein the act of seeing, the seen and the seer become one"" (Klossowki de Rola 1983, p. 8). All the evidence of these senses appealed to in such paintings— nostalgia, lubricity, frustration— work against such a reading.",664.0,"Artist

"Girl with Cat, 1937, Balthus","Most literature on this painting considers alternative identifications of the cat, with either Balthus’s model, Therese Blanchard, the daughter of a neighbor, or with the artist himself. The latter interpretation is supported by Balthus’s long-standing fascination with cats. In 1920, at the age of thirteen, he published a series of prints narrating the story of a cat called Mitsou; even more directly relevant to the artist’s personal identification with this animal is his 1935 self-portrait entitled H.M. the King of Cats (New York 1984, no. 9, ill.). In addition in the work of writers in Balthus’s circle, there is considerable support for the association of the cat with sexuality. Georges Bataille’s erotic novel Histoire de l’oeil (Paris, 1928), for instance, has a chapter entitled ""L’Oeil de chat"" (The Cat’s eye) in which a sixteen-year-old boy and girl engage in sexual play with a cat’s saucer of milk. However, an exclusive emphasis on these readings overstresses the biographical in Balthus’s work and overlooks the degree to which he refers to and plays upon traditions of representing sexuality in Western painting.",664.0,"Artist

"Girl with Cat, 1937, Balthus","The genre of salacious images of women with which Balthus’s Girl with Cat is aligned traditionally include a small animal: cat or lap dog. The most famous examples perhaps are Jean Antoine Watteau’s Lady at Her Toilette of 1716/17 (London, Wallace Collection) and Edouard Manet’s Olympia of 1865 (Paris, Musee d’ Orsay), but any number of thinly veiled Venuses or clothed beauties in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century painting carry, fondle, or are watched by a pet. Typical commentaries of the time would remark on how fortunate the pet was to enjoy such privileged proximity to the desired object. Unspoken, but often visually very obvious parallels were also made between the creature and the female body. Traditionally the animal thus has a double identity, related to both the artist/ voyeur and the female sex.",664.0,"Artist

"Girl with Cat, 1937, Balthus","The setting of Girl with Cat has many of the traditional trappings of the painter’s studio. Therese lies on a daybed that figures in several other paintings by Balthus; on the left, the back of an upholstered chair is barely recognizable because of the rococo swatch of blue fabric bunched around one of its arms (similar chairs appear in Balthus’s paintings The White Skirt of 1937 and Therese of 1938).",664.0,"Artist

"Are They Thinking about the Grape? (Pensent-ils au raisin?), 1747, François Boucher","Although he painted a broad range of subjects and executed designs for porcelain and tapestries, François Boucher’s canvases of pastoral themes represent his most influential contribution to 18th-century French art. These idealized visions of rustic life, indebted to Jean-Antoine Watteau’s images of fête galantes, or open-air courtship parties, typically feature shepherds and shepherdesses engaged in amorous pursuits. This work was inspired by a contemporary theater piece, which was first performed as a pantomime at a Parisian fair in 1745. The painting’s playfully coy title derives from that of an engraving of a similar image.",666.0,"Artist

"Terrace and Observation Deck at the Moulin de Blute-Fin, Montmartre, early 1887, Vincent van Gogh","This painting dates from the winter of 1887, roughly a year after Vincent van Gogh arrived in Paris to join his brother, the art dealer Theo van Gogh. It is one of a group of landscapes featuring the Butte Montmartre, a short climb from the apartment on the rue Lepic where Vincent and Theo lived. Montmartre was dotted with reminders of its quickly receding rural past—abandoned quarries, kitchen gardens, and three surviving windmills, including the Moulin de Blute-Fin. The nonfunctional mill had become a tourist attraction, affording spectacular panoramic views over Paris from the observation tower erected beside it.",673.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Painting), 1953/54, Mark Rothko","Known for an impassioned form of painting predicated on the poetics of color, Mark Rothko was one of the leading proponents of color-field painting, a type of nongestural Abstract Expressionism that entailed large canvases distinguished by monumental expanses of form and tone. The canvas of Untitled (Painting) burns with subtle variations of orange and yellow hues. The painting follows the characteristic format of Rothko’s mature work, according to which stacked rectangles of color appear to float within the boundaries of the canvas. By directly staining the fabric of the canvas with many thin washes of pigment and by paying particular attention to the edges where the fields interact, he achieved the effect of light radiating from the image itself. This technique suited his metaphysical aims: to offer painting as a doorway into purely spiritual realms, making it as immaterial and evocative as music, and to communicate directly the most essential, rawest forms of human emotion. Rothko described his art as the “elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea, between the idea and the observer.” In place of overt symbolism, he used color, overwhelming scale, and surface luminosity to elicit an emotive, profound response from the viewer.",674.0,"Artist

"CARVING: A Traditional Sculpture, 1972, Eleanor Antin","A landmark early feminist work, Eleanor Antin’s Carving: A Traditional Sculpture comprises 148 black-and-white photographs documenting the artist’s loss of 10 pounds over 37 days. Every morning she was photographed naked in the same four stances to record her barely perceptible self-induced weight loss. (The photographs from each day are arranged vertically, and the entire process can be read horizontally, like a filmstrip.) Antin’s performance purposely toyed with the traditional process of Greek sculptors, who were said to find their ideal form by chipping away at a block of marble and discarding any unnecessary material. The artist’s idea of “carving” her own body was inspired by an invitation from the Whitney Museum of Art for its biennial survey exhibition, which at the time restricted itself to the established categories of painting and sculpture, though this work was considered too conceptual for the exhibition.",677.0,"Artist

"Grapes, Lemons, Pears, and Apples, 1887, Vincent van Gogh","This is one of a group of related canvases featuring seasonal fruit that Vincent van Gogh painted in the fall of 1887. In these works, he simplified his palette, employed more vibrant colors, and used a thicker, broader paint application than he had earlier. Here he explored the use of complementary colors—yellow and purple, blue and orange, and red and green—in the service of chromatic intensity. The effect of these color contrasts is heightened by the pulsating pattern of brushstrokes that defines the tablecloth and creates a force field around the fruit. The painting was probably among the “violent still lifes”—to quote Van Gogh’s friend the painter Emile Bernard—that he included in the group exhibition of young avant-garde artists that he organized at a local restaurant in November–December 1887.",687.0,"Artist
