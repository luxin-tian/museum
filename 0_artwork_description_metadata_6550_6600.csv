"Large Bathers, 1896–c. 1898, Paul Cézanne","With the advent of industrialization in the 19th century, a corresponding call to nature also emerged. In an effort to temper society’s growing mechanization, social commentators encouraged people to spend more time outdoors, preferably in the country. The pictures in this gallery depict bathing for recreation, exercise, and general camaraderie. Munch and Cézanne show nude men frolicking outside with other men, as same-sex nude swimming by men was socially accepted and in some spheres openly encouraged. These artists heroicize their bathers, making them the embodiment of strength, virility, and morality. Munch in particular was drawn to the subject, partially as a result of his own poor health and due to the influence of the growing Freikörperkultur (Free Body Culture) movement, which advocated nudism, regular bathing, and soaking up the sun as a part of a path to physical and spiritual renewal. On the other hand, social mores forbade women from bathing nude; Renoir’s Splashing Bather, therefore, was a product of the artist’s imagination, a carefully arranged studio construction. The symbolism of nude female bathers differed from that of men; these women embody vulnerability, provocation, and sensuality. In addition to outdoor recreation, indoor pools in and around Paris were inundated with families from the growing bourgeoisie as the physical benefits of swimming were increasingly advertised. Aquatics were championed for sport, hygiene, and pleasure. Honoré Victorin Daumier lived close by one of the most popular swimming schools for women in Paris. As a result of his first-hand observations, he produced brutally satiric lithographs that removed the veil of the ideal for both male and female bathers. His bathers are clothed in contemporary swim attire and show none of the admirable physical characteristics of bathers depicted by Munch, Cézanne, or Renoir.",6558.0,"Artist

Bwami was responsible for instructing its members in a shared moral philosophy. The teachings were conveyed through proverbs, with both handmade and natural objects serving as memory aids. Instead of being worn in front of the face, masks were held in the hands, hung on fences, or even pulled over the ground with their long raffia beards.",6568.0,"Culture

"Hercules Slaying Envy, 1633/34, Christoffel Jegher","Peter Paul Rubens, like Rembrandt van Rijn, realized printmaking’s enormous potential. Rubens was more concerned with disseminating his style and reproducing his painted compositions than with creating original subjects in print. While several artists engraved Rubens’s paintings, only one, Christoffel Jegher, cut the nine surviving woodcuts based on his work. Both Jegher’s and Rubens’s names appear, with the privilege (an early form of copyright), at the lower right of the dramatic Hercules Slaying Envy. This composition relates to a painting that Rubens was completing at the time for James I of England; its scale and broad cutting admirably reflect the artist’s florid painting style.",6573.0,"Artist

"Plate, 1780/1820, Artist unknown","Unlike the Art Institute’s plate by Rudolph Drach (see 1907.122) on which the maker inscribed his name, many objects in the Pennsylvania German tradition are unmarked, obscuring authorship for subsequent generations. Creamy white slip (which appears yellow due to the lead glaze on top of it) was applied to the surface of this plate, onto which sgraffito decoration was incised. The addition of lightly applied copper oxide created green accents across the plate. Pennsylvania German vessels are further characterized by bold designs of tulips, stars, and hearts. This octagonal plate incorporates another tradition motif—the stylized pomegranate.",6583.0,"Artist

"Necklace Inscribed with the Name of King Pratapamalladeva, About 1650","The two innermost strands resemble rudraksha beads, made from the seeds of a large evergreen tree whose berries are commonly made into rosaries of 108 beads. Such prayer beads are most often worn by Shaivite ascetics, either around the neck or woven into their topknots. The third and fourth strands consist of tubular forms in a crescent shape known as hansuli. Each terminates in elaborate clasps, with the inner strand attached to a central amulet case. The outermost ring contains thirteen images of deities, including roundels of the eight mothers (ashtamatrikas), each depicted as the goddess Durga slaying the buffalo demon (Mahishasura).

"A Minimum Dymaxion Home, Elevation, 1931, Richard Buckminster Fuller","Perhaps the most famous design for a prefabricated house, Buckminster Fuller’s Dymaxion House design consumed him for over 30 years. Unlike other period references to the minimal home, Fuller’s idea was less related to space than to efficiency. In the hopes of obtaining “the maximum gain” from the minimum use of material and energy, the Dymaxion was modeled on the streamlined factory production of the automobile. This simplification extended to a centralized core housing that held all mechanical equipment while providing structural support for the mast-hung, lightweight hexagonal building. Although this design was never realized, Fuller included many of the innovative aspects of his Dymaxion House into his aluminum-clad Wichita house or Dymaxion Dwelling Machine, which was produced as a prototype in 1948.",6594.0,"Artist

"Fish Plate, 350/325 BC, Ancient Greek","This footed plate was made to serve succulent morsels of grilled seafood, like the fish that are painted on its surface. Greece and Italy are peninsulas projecting into seas brimming with marine life. A primary source of protein, seafood was a basic staple of the ancient Mediterranean diet; it remains so today. Keen observers of their subjects, ancient vase painters so accurately captured the shapes and markings of the fish they depicted that it is possible to identify most of them by species. On this example, three slightly different, pleasingly plump bream with bright white details appear to swim after one another. A running wave pattern around the central concavity, with a gently sloped floor for collecting juices or serving sauces, recalls the sea, the source of the bounty.",6597.0,"Culture
