"Study of a Male Nude, 1858, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","French artists in Rome often gathered at the Villa Medici for after-dinner drawing sessions. On one such occasion, in the company of Gustave Moreau, the young Degas made this study. The two artists depicted the same nude, but from different vantage points. Degas dated his study “1857 ”speculatively, many years later, but Moreau recorded “1858” at the time. The model’s dramatic pose—raised arm, eyes turned heavenward—was in keeping with the large-scale paintings favored by the French state in the 1850s. These tended to show heroic subject matter; the figure here could have been a potential prototype for a multifigure composition.",6603.0,"Artist

"A Picture of Ourselves, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","Since the early 1960s, David Hockney has sought ways to meld his modern aesthetic style with highly personalized subject matter. He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.",6611.0,"Artist

"A Picture of Ourselves, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.",6611.0,"Artist

"A Picture of Ourselves, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","It is perhaps Hockney’s Blue Guitar that has perpetuated the idea that Wallace Stevens was similarly inspired by Picasso’s Old Guitarist. Although Stevens was familiar with modern art and no doubt saw the painting when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1934, he insisted that no one picture inspired his famous poem.",6611.0,"Artist

"Pectoral, A.D. 200/800, Maya","This elegant chest ornament would have been part of a ruler’s ceremonial regalia. In Maya society, as among other Amerindian peoples, a ruler’s attire indicated rank, religious function, and place of origin. Such dress was highly regulated, and only members of the nobility wore jade and other greenstones as an expression of their wealth and high status. Moreover, these rare and valued stones were considered to be inherently sacred and powerful. By wearing jade regalia, kings directly associated themselves with the youthful green maize plant and life-giving blue-green waters.",6617.0,"Culture

"Sunday School Picnic Quilt, 1932, Jennie C. Trein","Jennie Trein, an accomplished quilt maker who reportedly made over one hundred quilts, designed this one to commemorate the collected memories of many a Sunday picnic. In a compression of time and space that mirrors the nature of memory, the quilt depicts both recurring and singular events as happening simultaneously. For example, in the border of the quilt, at top right, Trein depicts herself with her small twin daughters en route to the picnic, but in the central picnic scene, she illustrates one of her daughters as an adult, dressed in her nurse’s uniform and with a dog on a leash. Similarly, the young couple hiding behind the cabin is also shown eloping on horseback off in the distance.

"Untitled, 1965, Beauford Delaney","After living and working for years in New York, where he painted in a boldly expressionistic figurative style (see his Self-Portrait, 1991.27), Beauford Delaney moved to Paris in 1953, seeking greater personal and artistic freedom. There he joined a group of African American expatriates, including Richard Wright and James Baldwin, and embraced abstraction, producing works that explore different effects of color and light. This composition features a vibrant yellow palette typical of Delaney’s work; yellow was his preferred hue, and it carried associations with the sun and held a personal, spiritual significance. Interweaving the yellow with green and orange pigments, he created a lyrical, tapestry-like effect of layered brushwork.",6619.0,"Artist

"Avey, from Cane, 2000, Martin Puryear","Jean Toomer’s Cane is regarded as the highest literary achievement of the Harlem Renaissance and a masterpiece of African American writing, a blend of fiction, poetry, and drama set alternately in rural Georgia and Washington, D.C., among other locations. Puryear first read Cane while he was teaching at Fisk University, in Nashville, his first experience living in the south. He said that he related to the point of view of a visitor “looking at what so defines blackness in America, the agricultural life of the South, the sharecropping that had grown out of slavery.” In the late 1990s Puryear was asked to contribute illustrations to a new edition of the book. About his work for the project, Puryear has commented:
The overriding issue was to work in a two-dimensional medium. To make flat images is such a departure from what I do as a sculptor. I had seldom made woodcuts since my student days. The challenge was to create a set of images that would relate together in a familial way, suggestive of the narrative but not overtly so.",6626.0,"Artist

"Flowers and Insects, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), reign of Kangxi (1662–1722), Chai Zhenyi","This sensitively idyllic glimpse of nature is the collaborative work of two sisters, who resided in east coastal Hangzhou. The city’s mild climate and beautiful scenery attracted generations of intellectual elite. Fostered by that cultural ambience, both sisters became renowned as poets and painters, but their painting styles were quite distinct. Whereas Chai Jingyi specialized in semi-abstract images of nature that affirmed ideals of self-expression, Chai Zhengyi was most renowned for closely observant studies such as this. Depicted together with asters and Asiatic dayflowers, the fruiting wild rose (dog rose) places this scene in the autumn. Inhabiting this vegetation is a variety of graceful insects— the butterfly, mantis, locust, and other grasshoppers. Such creatures denoted the annual passage of seasons in early poetry, and from that literary tradition, became elegant and often allusive subjects of painting.",6629.0,"Artist

"Yellow Pressed Glass Tea Service for Leerdam, c. 1924, Hendrik Petrus Berlage","Dutch glass manufacturer Leerdam was known in the early 20th century for its promotion of technology, fair working conditions, and good design for the masses. The company often commissioned noted architects to produce lines of glassware, including this striking tea service designed by Piet Zwart and architect H. P. Berlage. Based on the geometries of the hexagon and circle, this set of bright yellow pressed-glass dishware was dimensioned so that lids and saucers could be used interchangeably. Berlage was one of the first modern architects in the Netherlands, and he was also active in the allied fields of furniture, wallpaper, and tableware design. Although the set was distinctive in color and geometric form, it followed Berlage’s ideal that objects be rich in visual information, but produced without applied ornament. Zwart went on to become a pioneer of advanced typographic design, affiliated with the Dutch group De Stijl and other groups in the international avant-garde.",6634.0,"Artist
