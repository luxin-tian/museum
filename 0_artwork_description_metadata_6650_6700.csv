"The Rhinoceros, 1515, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer never saw a rhinoceros in real life. Although the letterpress text atop this broadsheet suggests otherwise, he in fact copied the woodcut from a drawing and a description given by an eyewitness before the ship carrying this gift for the king of Portugal sank on the way from India. Nonetheless, despite the lack of direct observation, the resulting image was immensely popular and formed many people’s ideas of the animal’s appearance. As with religious images from this period, the replication of print gave this woodcut its own type of truth.",6651.0,"Artist

"Vase, 1903/9, Grueby Faience & Tile Co.","Inspired by the French earthenware at Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, William H. Grueby established his own firm in Boston the following year. By 1900, under the direction of George Prentiss Kendrick, Grueby Faience Company specialized in producing earthenware in solid shapes based on Asian precedents in a small spectrum of matte colors with elegant applied decoration. The color, shape, and symmetrical arrangement of daffodils on this vase evoke Japanese elements that Kendrick would have recognized through his involvement with the Boston Society of Art and Crafts. The beauty of Kendrick’s designs—along with the laborious handcrafting—made Grueby among the most popular pottery in the country. Unfortunately, Grueby’s devotion to time-consuming applied decoration led to the company’s demise.",6652.0,"Artist

"Playboy #38, 1990, Richard Misrach","For over 30 years, Richard Misrach has been producing an epic photographic poem on the American West, divided (in the manner of Dante or Ezra Pound) into sections called cantos. The Desert Cantos examines the places where civilization runs up against nature, with often-disastrous effects on the land. One section focuses on two Playboy magazines Misrach found near the Nevada Nuclear Test Site, propped up against a gutted television and used for shooting practice by locals. Although the women on the covers had been the intended targets, Misrach realized that the bullets had pierced many aspects of contemporary culture: not only centerfold models but also political figures like Oliver North and Gloria Steinem; celebrities such as Madonna, Ray Charles, and Dennis Quaid; advertisements for alcohol, cigarettes, and shampoo; and, as shown here, art-world personalities like Andy Warhol. Such imagery becomes, in Misrach’s enlarged photographs, emblematic of an American culture riddled with violence.",6657.0,"Artist

"The Mark on the Mirror Made by Breathing (Der Fleck auf dem Spiegel, den der Atemhauch schafft), 1977, Dieter Appelt","Dieter Appelt studied art, photography, and music, spending 18 years as an opera singer with the Deutsche Oper Berlin. In 1979 Appelt left the opera company to focus on visual arts. He has since produced a large body of photographs, often based in sculpture or performance and with himself as a subject, exploring themes of death, rebirth, and suffering. The title of this photograph is a quote from the 1910 novel Impressions of Africa (Impressions d’Afrique) by the French poet and playwright Raymond Roussel, whose fantastical and bizarre works were praised by his Surrealist contemporaries. This line—with its reference to mark-making, time, and ephemerality—has served Appelt as inspiration for his photographic work in general. Here, however, he enacts the phrase literally, creating a self-portrait of his engagement with picturing the intangible.",6658.0,"Artist

"Spice Box Shaped as a Skull, 17th century","A fitting accessory for an eerie end, this tiny macabre pendant—under an inch tall and wide—is also a rather surprisingly complicated spice box. The miniature spring-loaded button on the top opens the skull to reveal two sections, the back one divided into four compartments, and a panel engraved with the names of four aromatics: Negal (cloves), Muscha (nutmeg), Canel (cinnamon) and Schlag (schlagwasser, a mixture of brandy, primrose petals, and violets, thought to be a cardiac stimulant). The openings for the eye sockets, nasal passages, and missing teeth are not just anatomically correct; these perforations would have allowed the fragrances of the secreted spices to waft out and work their medicinal magic.",6659.0,"Title

"Glaive for the Bodyguard of Markus Sittikus von Hohenems, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, 1589","Pole arms (staff weapons) were used not only in warfare and hunting, but also in sporting combat and ceremonies. The term refers to a family of edged weapons attached to wooden staffs. With the exception of the lance, which remained the weapon of the mounted knight, all other staff weapons were wielded by men on foot by 1600. With the development of firearms and their introduction as infantry weapons, pole arms lost their importance on the field, and from the mid-16th century, they were reserved for use in sporting contests and by princely bodyguards for ceremony and parade. The blades lent themselves to embellishment—engraving, etching, or other forms of decoration—and provided a perfect surface for the coats of arms of noble or princely families. The ceremonial use of staff weapons continues to this day with the Swiss Guards at the Vatican and Britain’s Yeomen of the Royal Guard.",6665.0,"Title

"Untitled (Check 2), 1985, Sherrie Levine","Sherrie Levine first gained widespread critical recognition in the early 1980s for her photographic re-creations of famous works of art, typically by men, through which she questioned the ideals of high modernism and confronted issues of authorship, repetition, and authenticity. Although known for these works, which redefined the role of appropriation strategies, Levine’s concerns are never specific to any media; sculpture, drawing, and painting have always been a part of her practice. Later in her career, she began to make works inspired by the precedent of a generic type, rather than a particular work of art. Her series of stripe paintings, for example, refers to both Russian Suprematist painting of the first part of the 20th century and American Minimal painting of the 1960s. Untitled (Check 2) is from a series of game-board motifs, marking the first time Levine drew source material from outside the art-historical realm.",6670.0,"Artist

"Figures with Still Life, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","Since the early 1960s, David Hockney has sought ways to meld his modern aesthetic style with highly personalized subject matter. He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.",6679.0,"Artist

"The Massacre at Jerusalem, from The Story of Titus and Vespasian, 1650/75, Geraert Peemans","This tapestry belongs to the eight-piece Story of Titus and Vespasian suite designed by Charles Poerson, who practiced the French academic-decorative manner that supplanted the dramatic and monumental Flemish High Baroque. Poerson clearly based the series on book two of Tacitus’s The Jewish War (c. A.D. 75–79). Both Vespasian and his son Titus led the Roman troops during the First Jewish-Roman War (A.D. 66–73), a major rebellion by the Jews of Judaea against the Roman Empire. This tapestry depicts the massacre that took place at Jerusalem six months after the initial siege. The Arabian and Syrian soldiers who were part of Titus’s army slaughtered the Jews who were attempting to flee, cutting open their victims’ bellies to get the gold coins some of them had swallowed before surrendering to the Romans.

They also became common subjects for still-life paintings known as Vanitas, which symbolically represent the transience of life. The etchings of both Wenceslaus Hollar and Rembrandt van Rijn could represent the simultaneous beauty and fragility of existence. While still lifes in general are exceedingly rare in Rembrandt’s work, Hollar’s etching (1996.609) comes from a series of seashells, consisting of 38 plates. Rembrandt’s shell could have been inspired by Hollar’s work, though Rembrandt’s decision to render the shell in a three-dimensional space represents a marked difference between the two etchings.",6694.0,"Artist
