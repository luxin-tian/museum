"Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter, Gettysburg, July 1863, Alexander Gardner","Alexander Gardner documented America’s Civil War, concentrating on scenes in camp as well as the tragic aftermath of fighting. After the war, in 1865, he published Gardner’s Photographic Sketch Book of the War, two volumes of 50 prints each accompanied by floridly written descriptions of the scenes he and his photographic staff had witnessed. At Gettysburg—one of the deadliest battles, and a turning point in the conflict—he made the now iconic photograph of a Confederate sharpshooter in his final resting place. In recent years this picture has invited controversy, as historians have argued that Gardner and his assistants, wishing to heighten the impact of the image, moved the corpse, also seen in another photograph in the Sketch Book, and that the gun was in fact the photographer’s and not the soldier’s.",6700.0,"Artist

"A Flower Piece, from The Houghton Gallery, 1778, Richard Earlom","Richard Earlom was one of many talented printmakers to work on John Boydell’s massive printing project to reproduce Sir Robert Walpole’s painting collection at Houghton. The finished two-volume book included 162 prints, including 27 by Earlom. (The original works were sold to Catherine the Great and are now in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.) Earlom was particularly favored for his ability to re-create painterly tones in his mezzotints, as is evidenced by this Flower Piece and and Fruit Piece.",6701.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Bartolomaeus Spranger with an Allegory of the Death of His Wife, Christina Müller, 1600, Aegidius Sadeler, II","Aegidius Sadeler belonged to one of the great Netherlandish dynasties of reproductive printmakers. Sadeler went to Prague in about 1597 and worked at the court of Emperor Rudolph II. He was so admired for his portrait engraving that he was called the ""Phoenix of Engraving."" In this complex combination of portraiture and allegory, he paid homage to a contemporary Mannerist artist, Bartholomaeus Spranger. In deference to his fellow artist, Sadeler included a portrait of Spranger’s recently deceased wife, as was the custom in 17th­century Northern portraits.",6703.0,"Artist

"Statuette of a Lictor, First half of the 1st century AD, Ancient Roman","The official attendants and bodyguards of Roman magistrates known as lictors were usually citizens of low birth, such as freedmen (former slaves). Typically, as seen here, a lictor wore a toga and carried in his left hand the bundle of elm or birch rods tied with a red belt that symbolized the magistrates’ executive power. This statuette likely belonged to a larger historical relief depicting a ceremonial scene, perhaps on the breastplate of a bronze statue of a horse, where similar statuettes of lictors are known to have been displayed.",6712.0,"Culture

"Expanding Skyscraper: Presentation Drawing, Elevation Study, 1961, Reginald Malcolmson","Reginald Malcolmson came to Chicago in 1947 from Ireland to study with Mies van der Rohe at Illinois Institute of Technology. He subsequently worked in the Office of Mies van der Rohe from 1948 through 1955. He also was known throughout his career as a teacher and an architect of visionary and experimental projects.
His proposal for an expanding skyscraper is a theoretical project which would have allowed the creation of a larger and larger building formed by enclosing parts of the main structural skeleton. The main vertical axis is a megastructure containing the elevators and services for the whole tower. Enclosed volumes may be expanded and extended according to needs and demands. Parts of the whole may grow independently, but all parts are related to one another by the transportation and services at the core. The skyscraper could expand so much it becomes a vertical city.",6717.0,"Artist

"Cuirassier with Drawn Sword, modeled c. 1875 (cast after 1891), Jean Louis Ernest Meissonier","Ernest Meissonier was best known for his exquisitely rendered genre scenes, which drew inspiration from the Dutch masters and were praised for their “microscopic” perfection. But he was also a serious student of military subjects, creating a series of canvases on major episodes in the life of Napoleon I. For his battle scenes, Meissonier fashioned wax sculptures of horses and military figures, such as this cavalryman (known as a cuirassier), which served as a study for the painting 1807, Friedland (exhibited in the Salon of 1875). First shown to the public in 1891, Meissonier’s waxes were later cast in bronze to preserve the artist’s conception.",6720.0,"Artist

"Electric Lights and Buildings, c. 1931, Stuart Davis","Stuart Davis’s Electric Lights and Buildings was probably made in 1931, when the artist was creating drawings and lithographs that juxtaposed details of several cities in one view. This drawing demonstrates how Davis’s vision evolved from a scattered grouping of scenes into a reductive composition. His inclusion of separate scenes in one work was the result of his desire to compare and contrast New York, Paris, and Gloucester, Massachusetts, underscoring the composition with a Cubist grid.",6724.0,"Artist

"Marine Drinking, Battle for Saipan, June, 1944, W. Eugene Smith","A native of Wichita, Kansas, William Eugene Smith began his career photographing for local newspapers when he was fifteen and eventually became one of the most renowned photojournalists of the 20th century. The pictures he made as a correspondent in the Pacific theater during World War II are some of the most powerful war images ever produced. This photograph of a U.S. Marine on Saipan, for example, became a lasting icon for World War II, and for the horror and heroism of war in general. Smith was badly injured by mortar fire on Okinawa just months after making this image. After nearly two years of recovery, he devoted the rest of his career to photographic essays with a humanitarian bent.",6726.0,"Artist

"Hercules at the Crossroads (Jealousy), c. 1498, Albrecht Dürer","Renaissance humanists were fascinated by antiquity— its mythic heroes, surviving architecture, coins, and sculpture. Noblemen even demanded that the historians inflating their family trees make them stretch all the way back to Hercules and other demigods. Historical figures were occasionally given mythological nicknames, like the Protestant reformer Martin Luther, who was sometimes known by his supporters as the “German Hercules.” These two Hercules prints by Albrecht Dürer fed the fascination with this hero’s legendary strength, dogged perseverance in the 12 Labors, and tragic, inescapable fate.",6727.0,"Artist

"After the Bath (large version), 1891–92, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","Images of women washing themselves are ubiquitous in the history of Western art. The female nude in general has long been considered one of the most important subjects of artistic expression, most importantly in the form of history painting, traditionally represented in classical or biblical subjects. However, in the late 19th century progressive artists spurned traditional history painting in favor of contemporary subject matter—art of the moment that represented real life. The artists featured in this gallery made the theme of the bathing woman thoroughly modern. During this period, public health officials encouraged regular bathing not only for cosmetic reasons, but also as a means to combat diseases such as cholera. As a result, more and more people washed indoors regularly. The images in this gallery by Edgar Degas, Félix Vallotton, Pierre Bonnard, and Suzanne Valadon, for example, show modern accouterments of indoor plumbing—large porcelain tubs and taps for running water. Though these prints and drawings allude to contemporary industrial developments and evolving societal expectations, they remain principally devoid of narrative. They depict anonymous women across a range of social classes, including some models who were probably prostitutes, in the intimate act of washing. These artists used the subject of the bathing woman as an evocative means to an end—especially Degas, who returned to the theme of the bather literally hundreds of times between the late 1870s and his death in 1917. Degas utilized bathers to explore the possibilities of the human form—employing multiple angles and viewpoints, depicting its shape and various movements, and reflecting the many colors and textures of the environment.",6731.0,"Artist
