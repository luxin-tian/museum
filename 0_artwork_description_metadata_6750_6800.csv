"Bench (from the Helene Koerting Fischer home), 1938, Wharton Esherick","A pioneer of the American studio furniture movement, Wharton Esherick began his artistic career as a painter, but he was most prolific in the realm of woodwork, creating sculpture, furniture, and architecture. This bench was made for the home of Philadelphia businesswoman Helene Koerting Fischer as a hall bench that also housed the family’s growing record collection (cleverly placed within the drawers below the seat). It is a monumental work that is at once expressive and sculptural, gesturing toward Esherick’s desire to seamlessly join sculpture and furniture in a handcrafted, one-of-a-kind artwork that also reveals an interest in Expressionism.",6751.0,"Artist

"Portrait of a Man, c. 1660/65, Jan Mijtens","The Hague, the ancient seat of the counts of Holland, was dominated by the Dutch nobility and provided a ready clientele for Jan Mijtens’s elegant portraits. The artist practiced an international style of portraiture that had been developed by Dutch and Flemish painters working for foreign courts, among them Jan’s uncle and probable teacher, Daniel Mijtens, a court painter to Charles I of England. In this work, Mijtens gave the sitter a confident bearing, depicting him against a poetic twilight background that is indebted to the portrait conventions of Anthony van Dyck and hints at his status as a gentleman and landowner.",6758.0,"Artist

"Britannia Between Scylla and Charybdis, published April 8, 1793, James Gillray","The prolific James Gillray often included Classical nautical references in his contemporary political satires. Around the time of the French Revolution, Gillray depicted the British prime minister William Pitt as the wandering Odysseus, who pilots a small vessel holding the buxom Britannia through a dangerous strait toward the “Haven of Public Happiness.” Pitt attempts to steer between two conflicting forms of government: a whirlpool (Charybdis) on the right, symbolizing the crown and absolute monarchy, and a perilous rock with lurking monster (Scylla) on the left, representing democracy.",6759.0,"Artist

"Ornament with Women Fighting, c. 1460, Master E.S.","Master E. S., perhaps the most significant Northern printmaker working prior to Martin Schongauer, popularized this type of ornamental motif, which was widely used as a decorative model for later artists. This particular image depicts five naked women entangled in a mass of vines and leaves, fighting over undergarments to cover their exposed bodies. The comical subject reflects a sort of grotesque humor often found in engravings by Master E. S., especially his Fantastic Alphabet.",6760.0,"Artist

"Seated Woman from the Front with Hat, Face Hooded, 1910, Gustav Klimt","The intimate dramas playing out in this gallery draw their emotional power from the vulnerability of the exposed human form. Featured in these voyeuristic prints and drawings are private scenes of tragedy, tenderness, and horror, as artists intruded upon such previously forbidden settings as the bedroom, the deathbed, and the crime scene. While Félix Vallotton’s Intimacy woodcuts address the theme of undressing, with John Sloan’s playful Turning Out the Light and Gustav Klimt’s Seated Woman verging into the erotic, other images depict serious illnesses and the deaths of family members, especially children, which were commonplace events throughout the 19th century.",6762.0,"Artist

"Seated Woman from the Front with Hat, Face Hooded, 1910, Gustav Klimt","Making an explicit connection between sex and death is Otto Dix’s Murder, which pairs a bloody corpse with two dogs in the act of copulation. The Northern European artists Käthe Kollwitz and Edvard Munch drew on personal experiences for their devastating images of loss, seen here in stark scenes of grief. Kollwitz and the caricaturist Honoré Daumier (in an unusually somber mood) used similar iconographies of partially exposed corpses to make political statements: Daumier criticized the contemporary French government’s excessive response to a lower class riot in his Rue Transnonian, while Kollwitz drew on her own socialist sympathies in evoking war horrors in Raped, part of her series about the disastrous 1525 German Peasants’ War. The scattered feet of the family members in Daumier’s Transnonian and the nearly invisible child’s head to the left of Kollwitz’s splayed female body remind the viewer of these scenes’ universal themes.",6762.0,"Artist

"Abe no Nakamaro, from the series A True Mirror of Chinese and Japanese Poems, c. 1833, Katsushika Hokusai","This poet is also the seventh in the series One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets. The artist presents here the more mature Nakamaro seated on the terrace of a Chinese palace with a group of friends. He remained in China more than thirty years, never returning to his home near Nara. The poem implied here is the same as that in the other print, now directed to the moon itself. In spite of a successful career in China, he never became reconciled to his exile.",6778.0,"Artist

"Boys Bathing, 1899, Edvard Munch","With the advent of industrialization in the 19th century, a corresponding call to nature also emerged. In an effort to temper society’s growing mechanization, social commentators encouraged people to spend more time outdoors, preferably in the country. The pictures in this gallery depict bathing for recreation, exercise, and general camaraderie. Munch and Cézanne show nude men frolicking outside with other men, as same-sex nude swimming by men was socially accepted and in some spheres openly encouraged. These artists heroicize their bathers, making them the embodiment of strength, virility, and morality. Munch in particular was drawn to the subject, partially as a result of his own poor health and due to the influence of the growing Freikörperkultur (Free Body Culture) movement, which advocated nudism, regular bathing, and soaking up the sun as a part of a path to physical and spiritual renewal. On the other hand, social mores forbade women from bathing nude; Renoir’s Splashing Bather, therefore, was a product of the artist’s imagination, a carefully arranged studio construction. The symbolism of nude female bathers differed from that of men; these women embody vulnerability, provocation, and sensuality. In addition to outdoor recreation, indoor pools in and around Paris were inundated with families from the growing bourgeoisie as the physical benefits of swimming were increasingly advertised. Aquatics were championed for sport, hygiene, and pleasure. Honoré Victorin Daumier lived close by one of the most popular swimming schools for women in Paris. As a result of his first-hand observations, he produced brutally satiric lithographs that removed the veil of the ideal for both male and female bathers. His bathers are clothed in contemporary swim attire and show none of the admirable physical characteristics of bathers depicted by Munch, Cézanne, or Renoir.",6790.0,"Artist

"Amazon, 2005, AK Dolven","In her films, photographs, and videos, A K (Anne Katrine) Dolven explores notions of female beauty, the Romantic sublime, and temporal transformation. Rich in art-historical and conceptual references, her typically pared-down settings blend the surreal and uncanny with prosaic depictions of everyday rituals, subverting normal expectations—for example, a little girl’s bedroom is inhabited by an elderly woman, Edvard Munch’s 1902 woodcut The Kiss is restaged in a techno club, and a corporate office becomes the setting for a modern-day Madonna and Child.
Amazon—arguably the artist’s most powerful film to date—depicts an androgynous archer repeatedly raising and drawing a bow, which casts sharp shadows across the figure’s chest. Close-up views of neck, shoulder, and upper arm muscles snapping between tension and rest are visually dissected by short sequences and rapid changes in camera angle. As Andrea Schlieker observed, “Dolven has used the transformative power of the body fragment to great effect” in her films. The choice of 16mm film and the small scale of the projected image add to the sense of intimacy conveyed by the close-up camera work. The artist has stated, “The way I use the frame in video is similar to the way I would use the four sides of a painting. I am interested in what we ‘see’ in the work, in how you touch the edge, but also how it touches upon an ‘unseen’ element, an element of the imagination, which exists outside the frame.” Vacillating between close-ups and mid-shots, the camera never reveals the identity of the protagonist, allowing the imagination to fill in the blanks.
Dolven deftly conveys a lifetime of experience in a fleeting one and a half minutes; the film is looped in such a way as to allow repeated viewings, each one divulging new information without ever telling the whole story. The piece ends with a quick mid-shot of the archer’s bare torso, exposing a missing breast. Referring to the mythic race of female warriors who were said to cut off their right breasts to facilitate the drawing of the bow and increase the accuracy of their arrows, the title conveys the harnessed strength, courage, and physical determination required to overcome breast cancer and the other corporeal obstacles women may face.",6795.0,"Artist
