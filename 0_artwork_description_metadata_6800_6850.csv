"Settlement Units Density Studies, Aerial Perspective, c. 1943, Ludwig Karl Hilberseimer","Ludwig Hilberseimer was a German architect and urban planner who emigrated to Chicago and became chair of the Illinois Institute of Technology’s Department of City and Regional Planning. After working on experimental plans for a High-Rise City (Hochhausstadt) in the 1920s, Hilberseimer shifted the scale of his planning studies to focus on the settlement unit, a new type of urban development based on low-rise houses. The settlement unit was a residential group whose size was controlled to allow inhabitants to travel to work on foot, thus mediating between the scale of the city and the needs of the individual house. Hilberseimer modeled his settlement unit on a pattern of small, attached, L-shaped houses in long rows designed to maximize privacy at a relatively high density and to promote a fruitful repetition and standardization.",6800.0,"Artist

"Pulling Oars under Clearing Autumn Skies (Distant Mountains), Ming dynasty (1368–1644); c. 1545, Lu Zhi","Landscape painting offered artists the opportunity to create visual poems about the beauty and continuity of nature and man’s place in it. Lu Zhi, a 16th-century artist, belonged to a class of highly educated men who painted for their own pleasure. In Distant Mountains, he used multiple ground planes and suggestive voids to create a majestic vista of jagged peaks and a meandering, wide river. Through the crystalline precision of his brush strokes, the artist achieved an image of great clarity and refinement.",6803.0,"Artist

"Untitled (Study for Cubi VII), 1963, David Smith","Untitled (1963) is a study for the Art Institute’s stainless-steel sculpture Cubi VII (1963), which presently sits in the North Garden. The strength and weight of Cubi VII are counteracted by the awe-inspiring balance of its forms, leaving the viewer marveling at the dichotomy between material and form. David Smith’s untitled spray drawing, however, tells a much different story about the artist’s methodology. The drawing evinces Smith’s careful planning and selective juxtaposition of the geometric shapes that characterize the Cubi series. Moreover, it allows the viewer to appreciate both Smith’s technique as a sculptor and his skill as a draftsman on a more intimate, elemental level.",6811.0,"Artist

"Halberd for the Bodyguard of Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein, 1632","Pole arms (staff weapons) were used not only in warfare and hunting, but also in sporting combat and ceremonies. The term refers to a family of edged weapons attached to wooden staffs. With the exception of the lance, which remained the weapon of the mounted knight, all other staff weapons were wielded by men on foot by 1600. With the development of firearms and their introduction as infantry weapons, pole arms lost their importance on the field, and from the mid-16th century, they were reserved for use in sporting contests and by princely bodyguards for ceremony and parade. The blades lent themselves to embellishment—engraving, etching, or other forms of decoration—and provided a perfect surface for the coats of arms of noble or princely families. The ceremonial use of staff weapons continues to this day with the Swiss Guards at the Vatican and Britain’s Yeomen of the Royal Guard.",6814.0,"Title

"From The Mountain Lake Screen Tachi Series, 1990, Ôkura Jirô",今回は大倉の制作した全16組のうち、5組のみが展示されているが、いずれもチラチラ光り、都市景観を思わせる直立したモニュメントである。16組全てを横に並べれば、壁を創り出し、長さは約120フィートになる。パネルは、穴をくり抜いた黒色くるみ材に黒と朱色の絵具を塗り、その後全面に大まかに金箔を兎の膠で貼り付けている。イミテーションの金箔片が、僅かな空気の動きにも揺れ、光を捉えてきらめく。時の経過とともに、金箔の小片は屏風から剥がれ落ち、木材は自然の状態に戻るというのが、作者の意図である。自らの作品が徐々に変容することの容認は、仏教の強調する自然の絶え間ない状況変化のメタファーと考えられる。,6821.0,"Artist

"From The Mountain Lake Screen Tachi Series, 1990, Ôkura Jirô","Although only ﬁve screens from the series are on display here, Okura created sixteen in all, each its own vertical monument recalling a glimmering cityscape. When all sixteen are set up side by side, they create the effect of a wall about one hundred and twenty feet in length. The panels have been made of black walnut that has been distressed and painted with black and cinnabar red pigment, and then loosely covered over the entire surface with gold foil adhered with rabbit-skin glue. Pieces of imitation gold leaf sway with the slightest movement of air and glisten as they catch the light. It is the artist’s intention that, over time, bits of the gold leaf will fall from the screens and the wood will return to its natural state. His acceptance of the gradual transformation of his art can be taken as a metaphor for the ever-changing condition of nature stressed in Buddhism.",6821.0,"Artist

"Figure, 1937, Henry Spencer Moore","Henry Moore’s seven-decade artistic career began with his early interest in non-Western art. Initially inspired by the African, Oceanic, and especially Pre-Columbian art that he saw at the British Museum in London, Moore, like Constantin Brâncusi, became a passionate proponent of direct carving, a technique that allowed the inherent qualities of materials to dictate a sculpture’s final form. In the 1930s, Moore merged his interest in non-Western art with aspects of abstraction and Surrealism, which he encountered during his regular trips to Paris. Works like Figure reveal Moore’s engagement with the organic, biomorphic forms used by contemporary Surrealist artists such as Jean Arp, Alberto Giacometti, and Joan Miró.",6823.0,"Artist

"291, 1915, Francis Picabia","In 1915, Marius de Zayas (1880-1961), a Mexican artist, theorist, and gallery owner, planned a new publication called 291 after Alfred Stieglitz’s influential gallery of the same name. The magazine was inspired by de Zayas’ s discoveries in France during 1914 of Italian Futurist and French concrete poetry and typography. The focus of 291 was modem art, satire, and critism. Francis Picabia, who helped create 291, guest-edited the July-August 1915 issue exhibited here. This issue contains reproductions of five drawings by Picabia based on this theme of symbolizing individuals as machines. This print is a portrait of Alfred Stieglitz.",6826.0,"Artist

It was made as a devotional gift for a god and was probably deposited at a religious site.

"Self-Portrait, 1898/1906, Frederick William MacMonnies","Around 1898 Frederick W. MacMonnies suddenly abandoned his successful career as a sculptor to take up painting, but a lack of commercial success ultimately forced him to quit the medium in about 1906. At least nine self-portraits from this period are known. While in several of these MacMonnies holds a palette and brush, here he does not identify as an artist. Rather he portrayed himself as a gentleman of leisure, dressed and ready to attend a casual gathering. Part of a group of expatriate American artists living and working in Paris and Giverny, MacMonnies drew inspiration from the Old Masters, especially in the lighting and modeling of the figure, and from the Impressionists, whose loose brushwork and high-keyed colors likewise inform the composition.",6837.0,"Artist

"The Angel Appearing to the Shepherds, 1634, Rembrandt van Rijn","This nocturnal scene from the Gospel of Luke represents Rembrandt’s first attempt to render shadows in print with the same gravity and depth he achieved in oil paint. In the upper left, an angel stands before a glowing celestial vortex and announces the birth of Christ. At the center of the divine light is the dove of the Holy Spirit, defined by a few small marks. Terrified by the sudden blast in the night, herdsman and their beasts run amok.
To depict the stunning collision between heaven and earth, Rembrandt first scratched a detailed compositional outline with a sharp needle and etched lines. He then built a range of grays and deep blacks by crisscrossing layers of lines in varying widths. This fine netting of shadow echoes the spontaneity of the moment and differs from the rigidity and systematized decorative patterns seen in the work of predecessors such as Hendrik Goudt.",6848.0,"Artist
