"The Rape of a Sabine Woman, Frontal View, c. 1598, Jan Harmensz. Muller","Jan Harmensz Müller produced a series of masterful engravings from three different vantage points after wax models for Adriaen de Vries’s sculpture Rape of a Sabine. Although De Vries cast his sculpture around 1620, long after Müller produced his prints, he replicated the style of antique bronzes. Müller’s series highlights both his engraving skill and his ability to mimic sculpture in the round. The ancient story, in which Roman soldiers requisitioned brides en masse, is particularly apt for this purpose, for the images showcase the twists and turns of conflicting male and female bodies.",6853.0,"Artist

"The Angel Appearing to the Shepherds, 1634, Rembrandt van Rijn","This nocturnal scene from the Gospel of Luke represents Rembrandt’s first attempt to render shadows in print with the same gravity and depth he achieved in oil paint. In the upper left, an angel stands before a glowing celestial vortex and announces the birth of Christ. At the center of the divine light is the dove of the Holy Spirit, defined by a few small marks. Terrified by the sudden blast in the night, herdsman and their beasts run amok.
To depict the stunning collision between heaven and earth, Rembrandt first scratched a detailed compositional outline with a sharp needle and etched lines. He then built a range of grays and deep blacks by crisscrossing layers of lines in varying widths. This fine netting of shadow echoes the spontaneity of the moment and differs from the rigidity and systematized decorative patterns seen in the work of predecessors such as Hendrik Goudt.",6855.0,"Artist

"Whistler’s Mother, after Whistler, c. 1883, Henri Charles Guérard","This print by the accomplished etcher Henri Charles Guérard reproduces Whistler’s painting on the occasion of its exhibition at the Paris Salon of 1883, where it was shown under the more simple title “Portrait de ma mère” (Portrait of my mother). The print was commissioned for publication in the Gazette des beaux-arts, the most widely read French journal on the arts. Though it doubtlessly helped circulate the painting’s image to a French audience, Whistler later dismissed the print, preferring to control the authorship of such images more directly.",6862.0,"Artist

"Painted Banner (Thangka) of Bodhisattva Maitreya Surrounded by his Retinue, 16th century","The bodhisattva Maitreya, the Buddha of the future, and the successor of Shakyamuni Buddha, is identifiable by the tiny, gold waterpot perched on the lotus near his shoulder at right. He is flanked by two other bodhisattvas; the green one is Vajrapani and the golden one is most likely Manjusri. Collectively, these three deities represent Shakyamuni Buddha’s virtues: Maitreya is the manifestation of his compassion, Manjusri is the manifestation of his wisdom; and Vajrapani is the manifestation of his power. Most of the deities in the margins form part of the bodhisattva’s retinue. The monk who officiated at the thangka’s consecration is at lower right in white.",6883.0,"Title

"The Organ Player and His Wife, 1495/1503, Israhel van Meckenem, the younger","Here a couple making music in a comfortable interior is an image of harmony. The wife assists the husband by working the bellows of the portative organ, and her open mouth suggests that he is accompanying her song. This is one of a series of six engravings by Meckenem showing couples engaging in music making, card playing, and other pastimes in domestic settings. The engraver elaborated on the household details with particular care, delineating a curtained bed, a built-in cupboard open to show a basin and covered cup, and an extendable table holding the organ. Above the wife’s head is a convex mirror, which was still a luxury item in 1500.",6886.0,"Artist

"Pan and Syrinx, n.d., Georg Wechter","Known for his lustful appetite, Pan preyed upon hapless nymphs. When Pan pursued her to a river’s edge, the skilled huntress Syrinx appealed to Artemis, goddess of chastity, who transformed her into the surrounding river reeds to save her. Pan’s frustrated sigh sounded across the hollow reeds, which he then fashioned into the set of pipes that became his attribute. This 16th-century German drawing references details from book one of Ovid’s Metamorphoses such as the quiver Syrinx grasps as she escapes: “When [Pan] thought he now had Syrinx, found that instead of the nymph’s body he only held reeds from the marsh; and, while he sighed there, the wind in the reeds, moving, gave out a clear, plaintive sound. Charmed by this new art and its sweet tones the god said ‘This way of communing with you is still left to me.’”",6893.0,"Artist

"Two Maps I, 1965–66, Jasper Johns","Jasper Johns had no experience with printmaking until he began working with Tatyana Grosman in 1960 at the Universal Limited Art Editions workshop on Long Island (founded in 1957). He continually complicated the processes of printmaking, making them an integral part of his working scheme. The repeatable nature of printmaking afforded him the opportunity to retain each stage of his projects and rework or recontextualize images as he wished. By using and reusing motifs, like numbers and letters, he deflected attention away from his subjects and to his techniques, which allowed him and the viewer to visit each subject in various conditions: color or monochrome, hard papers or softer ones, and transparent or more opaque inks.",6895.0,"Artist
