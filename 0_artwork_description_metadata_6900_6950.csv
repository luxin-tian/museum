"Self-Portrait (No. 19), 1983, Ivan Albright","In 1981 Albright began a series of drawn and painted self-portraits at the invitation of the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence, which for four centuries has collected other significant examples of this motif. For the next two years, ending with his death in 1983, the artist, energized by this great honor, created around 24 small self-portraits in various media, a series that constitutes a summation of his vision and technical prowess.",6901.0,"Artist

"Ceremonial Sword (Ape), Mid–20th century, Yoruba","With its circular handle, foliate-shaped blade, and detailed openwork, this ceremonial sword illustrates associations between the Yoruba kingdom of Owo and the Benin kingdom to the south. A strong connection between the two existed by the 16th century, and much of Owo’s regalia derived from Benin’s royal court. In Owo ceremonial swords may belong to a king or his chiefs. The openwork on this sword identifies the courtly title of its original owner. Olufowose can be translated as “one who has made money and used it properly,” and Alaijebi means “one who is innocent.” Together the title suggests a rank gained fairly through sudden wealth.",6906.0,"Culture

"Jephtha’s Daughter, 1874, Chauncey Bradley Ives","This sculpture by Chauncey Bradley Ives presents a character from the Old Testament book of Judges. An Israelite leader engaged in war against the Ammonites, Jephtha made a promise to God that if his army was victorious, he would sacrifice whoever met him upon his return home from battle. Jephtha’s army prevailed, but when he arrived at his house, he was met by his only child, a virgin daughter. Here we see the young woman grieving over her imminent death, her tambourine stilled and her head and shoulders drooping with the weight of her knowledge. For audiences of the day, this work represented a form of tragic female bravery—a victim who was innocent, obedient, and pure.",6911.0,"Artist

"Blanket, 1880s/90s, Navajo (Diné)","Brillant color and bold overall patterns with serrated diamonds, chevrons, and interlocking lines are hallmarks of the ""Eye Dazzler"" style of Navajo (Diné) textiles produced from the late-19th to the early-20th century. Earlier Navajo blankets featured broad horizontal bands of indigo blue, white, dark brown, black, and red, subsequently enhanced with the addition of small diamonds, bars, and squares. The lively approach of Eye Dazzler weaving developed out of a period of major cultural and artistic transformation beginning in 1864 when the U.S. government forcefully resettled the Navajo in the Bosque Redondo reservation. From the early 1860s, the Navajo received brightly colored commercial yarns as part of their U.S. government annuities. The new Eye Dazzler weaving also incorporated design elements characteristic of Mexican Saltillo blankets, which featured serrated diamonds and zigzag lines.
The creator of this blanket fully utilized the intense color of commercially dyed yarns and the Saltillo style to create a spectacular work. Internlocking serrated undulating lines appear to vibrate over the entire surface. The vivid interplay of red and orange hues with brillant blues, greens, yellow, white, and black produces an energetic, three-dimensional illusion.

"Type B, 1986, Christopher Wool","Christopher Wool’s paintings explore the points of intersection between signage and language, pattern and decoration. Born in Boston and raised in Chicago, Wool moved to New York in the 1970s and aligned himself with a group of artists, filmmakers, and musicians associated with the punk rock movement. In the mid-1980s, he began to use printmaking techniques— including patterned paint rollers, rubber stamps, stencils, and silkscreens—to create enamel on metal works, often featuring filigree or floral motifs. The monochromatic black-and-white Type B, one of the artist’s earliest paintings to use printmaking methods, ironically recalls the action paintings of Jackson Pollock.",6923.0,"Artist

"Bacchanal with a Wine Vat, c. 1470, Andrea Mantegna","Andrea Mantegna was an artist with a deep interest in antiquity, and much of his work resembled Greco-Roman sculpture, which he translated into widely circulating and frequently copied engravings. This is the left half of a pair of prints; the adjoining print Bacchanal with Silenos (1956.1010) is also in the Art Institute’s collection. Mantegna’s frieze-shaped bacchanalian subjects portray the god of wine and his drunken revelers. Dionysos may be the standing youth on the left, who is being crowned with a wreath of grape leaves. His noble bearing and contrapposto stance link him particularly to ancient sculptures.",6924.0,"Artist

"The Penance of Saint John Chrysostom, c. 1510, Giulio Campagnola","This luminous unique impression suggests a more linear version of Campagnola’s dappled, early stipple engraving style, characterized by many small dots in different sizes, volumes, and shades. The composition tells an apocryphal legend of Saint John Chrysostom, in which the saint, living as a hermit, seduces and impregnates the daughter of an emperor. Shocked by his own actions, John throws the princess from a cliff and vows never to rise from the ground in penance for his misdeeds. After the princess and her child are miraculously discovered still alive, John’s sins are forgiven. In Campagnola’s composition, the princess and child are presented in the foreground while John is depicted walking on all fours in the background. The female nude is reminiscent of Campagnola’s Woman Reclining in a Landscape.",6937.0,"Artist

"Male Face Mask (Zauli), Early/mid–20th century, Guro","Forming a dance trio with masks known as gu and zamble (also on display in this case), zauli—or, “the Ugly”—is sometimes identified as zamble’s elder brother or father, and functions as his handsome counterpart. Zauli is everything that zamble is not: dirty, disorderly, brusque, rude, greedy, and somewhat funny. The mask is both admired and feared for its sudden mood swings and supernatural power. Even though Guro masks are now held primarily for entertainment, they were originally developed to divert evil.",6941.0,"Culture

"The Agility and Audacity of Juanito Apinani in the ring at Madrid, plate 20 from The Art of Bullfighting, 1814/16, published 1816, Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes","From 1785 to 1814, the laws regulating bullfighting in Spain were changed four times by succeeding governments. These regulations varied wildly depending on the government’s political bent, ranging from outright prohibition to free admission for all. Due to its politicization, bullfighting became a useful metaphor for societal conflict, which Francisco de Goya employed to obliquely comment on the Spanish body politic. For instance, Goya often pictured the spectators as compositionally divided—either huddled at the right of the print or crowded to the left as in this work—recalling stark divisions in Spanish society.",6943.0,"Artist
