"Container for Water or Beer, Mid–/late 20th century, Shona","Although cooking vessels are usually left unembellished, Shona storage containers are often burnished to a high sheen, and potters sometimes rub them with graphite powder to achieve a metallic luster. Then they ornament the pots around the shoulder with bold geometric patterns, most frequently simple crosshatched bands or large triangles in alternating black and ocher. By the early 1960s, some potters had also begun to use enamel or oil-based paint on their wares in place of more traditional pigments. The glossy red and black paints that embellish this Shona water container, for example, evoke the traditional graphite and ocher palette. The straightforward pattern of alternating red and black zigzags and triangles is beautifully proportioned to the size of the pot and is outlined with a wide, confidently drawn groove. The thin red ring painted around the pot’s inner lip is a subtle finishing touch.",6950.0,"Culture

"Lily Lamp, 1902/17, Tiffany Studios","In the 1890s, Louis Comfort Tiffany combined his Favrile glass with the relatively new technology of electricity to produce his first lamp, the form for which he would become most famous. The lily lamp won a grand prize at the International Exposition of Modern Decorative Art in Turin, Italy, in 1902. Although the original version of the lamp had 18 lights, the firm went on to manufacture smaller versions with 7, 10, and 12 bulbs. Combining Tiffany’s iridescent Favrile glass with masterfully naturalistic work in metal, this design became one of the firm’s most popular. Its sinuous asymmetry demonstrated Tiffany’s strong ties to Art Nouveau.",6956.0,"Artist

"Fragment of a Column Krater (Mixing Bowl), 580/570 BC, Ancient Greek","This fragment comes from a large bowl that was used to mix wine and water before it was served. Unusually, it is decorated in two techniques. The bearded man holding a spear and the animals to the right and below the scene are decorated in the black-figure technique, but the other figures are simply outlined. The use of yellow for the man’s garment is also unusual.
Corinth
The seventh century marks the beginning of the Archaic period (700–480 B.C.). In Corinth, geometric patterns that had embellished the pottery of the preceding era gave way to depictions of animals, both real and imaginary, and sometimes humans and gods. Painters also explored new ways of decorating their pots, including the outline technique. Ultimately, they settled on painting their subjects in silhouette with black gloss and created details by incising through the black to reveal the lighter clay below and sometimes adding reddish-purple or creamy white gloss. This method of decoration is called the black-figure technique.",6968.0,"Culture

Munakata Shikô (1903-75) was one of the most distinguished Japanese printmakers of the twentieth century, renowned for combining bold imagery with traditional subject matter. Born in the remote northern province of Aomori, Munakata moved to Tokyo and became a member of the Creative Print (Sôsaku Hanga) movement. In contrast to the collaborative process of traditional ukiyo-e, Creative Print artists designed, carved, and printed their own woodblocks. Within this movement, Munakata developed his own exhuberant style of printmaking. Extremely nearsighted, he kept his face almost at the surface of the woodblock when carving, and could rarely view his art in its entirety. Yet he worked with an intutive spontaneity, wielding his carving tools with great speed.",6969.0,"Artist

As he became involved with the twentieth-century Japanese Folk Art (Mingei) movement, Munakata also began to expore Buddhist imagery. He frequently included the word ""stake"" (saku, an offering of Buddhist pilgrims) in his titles, thus associationg his printmaking with a Buddhist devotional act. As Munakata wrote, ""At every stage in my career I like to leave behind a print or picture as if I were offering a prayer."" Munakata’s approach and subject matter distinguish him from his Creative Print contemporaries, who favored figural studies and landscapes.",6969.0,"Artist
