"The Happy Accident of the Swing, 1792, Nicolas Delaunay","Fragonard painted his masterpiece, The Swing after another artist had refused the risqué commission offered by a gentleman of the English court who wanted a portrait of himself surreptitiously observing his mistress on a swing. The result epitomized the themes and unapologetically decorative flounces of the Rococo style. In this print the airy textures of the painting have been transformed into elegantly engraved patterns befitting the motion, outdoor setting, and eroticism of the scene.",7012.0,"Artist

Enameled gold and pin-fastened pearls add vigorous effects of color, texture, and light.

"Madonna with the Monkey, c. 1498, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer’s touchingly delicate landscape engraving of the Madonna with the Christ Child in her arms and a domesticated monkey has been the subject of many subsequent interpretations. One of the earliest, broadly rethought by the Master M. Z., is also on display nearby, while the background reappears in another Art Institute work, Giulio Campagnola’s Ganymede. In contrast, Agostino Veneziano in Italy and the Wierix brothers in the Netherlands would try their hand at reproducing the composition exactly.",7029.0,"Artist

"Olympia (published plate), 1867, Édouard Manet","Paris was the undisputed artistic and cultural capital of Europe in the late 19th century; it was also home to a thriving population of prostitutes. As Hollis Clayson observed in her study of prostitution and French art, Painted Love, artists of the period, particularly the Impressionists, enthusiastically embraced the activities of these women through varying degrees of realistic imagery. The increasingly abstract depictions of prostitutes’ everyday pursuits, from bathing to entertaining clients, possessed a risky, modern, and voyeuristic flair. Artists also capitalized on the ambiguity of their subjects’ profession, as many of these women moved fluidly between being a dancer, actress, courtesan, brothel resident, street prostitute, or some combination thereof.",7033.0,"Artist

"Olympia (published plate), 1867, Édouard Manet","While Édouard Manet’s print Olympia, which reinterpreted the controversial painting of the same name (Musée d’Orsay, Paris), implies an expensive sexual transaction by emphasizing its subject’s nudity through the contrast of monochrome crosshatched lines and blank fleshy areas, Edgar Degas depicted the high-class brothel in frankly observed yet lushly colorful pastels over monotype. These works deftly reflect the inverse correlation between the amount of clothing worn by the women and the asking price for their services. On the other hand, lower-class working women were expected to be more completely dressed as well as unemotional in carrying out their perfunctory duties, as seen in Albert Bertrand’s shadowed, cleavage-proffering Street Walker. The provocatively bared buttocks and infantalizing pigtails in Félicien Rops and Jean Louis Forain’s prints underscore the expensive preference for presumed virgins in many of the most refined brothels. These deluxe establishments would double their earnings in 1878 during the Paris Exposition Universelle.",7033.0,"Artist

"The Crossing of the Granicus, from The Story of Alexander the Great, 1619, Karel van Mander, II","This tapestry dramatizes a battle fought in 334 B.C. between the Macedonians and the Persians. Alexander the great, king of the Macedonians, is depicted just left of center; dressed in ornate gilt armor, he rides a white horse and raises a sword boldly above his head. Facing him is a Persian general on a dark horse with both hands grasped around an axe. Although Alexander appears imperiled, he was ultimately victorious in the battle. the tense moment represented here provided a compelling narrative for noble patrons in the 17th century, willing to imagine Alexander’s triumphs as equivalent to their own.",7039.0,"Artist

"State Street, Jewelry Shop, c. 1951, Arthur Siegel","A student and later a faculty member at the Institute of Design, where he taught on and off for three decades, Arthur Siegel was known for photographs that combined avant-garde experimentalism with documentary practice. Beginning in the late 1940s, he worked almost exclusively in color—a highly unconventional choice for the time. In 1951, shortly after undergoing Freudian psychoanalysis, he began the series In Search of Myself, which captured anonymous shoppers on Chicago’s State Street as a means to explore the relationship between identity and consumerism. In this image, Siegel took advantage of the repeated reflections in shop windows to blend shoppers, commodities, and the streets in a dizzying urban bustle.",7042.0,"Artist

Art has held itself aloof from the great movement, which for half a century has engrossed all forms of human activity in profitably exploiting the natural forces that fill heaven and earth. Instead of calling to his aid the enormous forces ever ready to serve the wants of the world, as an assistance in those mechanical and unnecessarily fatiguing portions of his labor, the artist has remained true to processes which are primitive, traditional, narrow, small, egotistical, and over-scrupulous, and thus has lost the better part of his time and energy. These processes date from the days when man believed himself alone in the universe, confronted by innumerable enemies. Little by little he discovers that these innumerable enemies were but allies and mysterious slaves of man which had not been taught to serve him. Man, to-day, is on the point of realizing that everything around him begs to be allowed to come to his assistance, and is ever ready to work with him and for him, if he will but make his wishes understood. This glad message is daily spreading more widely through all the domains of human intelligence. The artist alone, moved by a sort of superannuated pride, has refused to listen to the modern voice. He reminds one of one of those unhappy solitary weavers, still to be found in remote parts of the country, who, though weighed down by the misery of poverty and useless fatigue, yet absolutely continues to weave coarse fabric by an antiquated and obsolete method, and this although but a few steps from his cabin are to be found the power of the torrent, of coal and of wind, which offer to do twenty times in one hour the work which cost him a long month of slavery, and to do it better. / It is already many years since the sun revealed to us its power to portray objects and beings more quickly and more accurately than can pencil or crayon. It seemed to work only its own way and at its own pleasure. At first man was restricted to making permanent that which the impersonal and unsympathetic light had registered. He had not yet been permitted to imbue it with thought. But to-day it sees that thought has found a fissure through which to penetrate the mystery of this anonymous force, invade it, subjugate it, animate it, and compel it to say such things as have not yet been said in all the realm of chiaroscuro, of grace, of beauty and of truth. / MAURICE MAETERLINCK""
