Art has held itself aloof from the great movement, which for half a century has engrossed all forms of human activity in profitably exploiting the natural forces that fill heaven and earth. Instead of calling to his aid the enormous forces ever ready to serve the wants of the world, as an assistance in those mechanical and unnecessarily fatiguing portions of his labor, the artist has remained true to processes which are primitive, traditional, narrow, small, egotistical, and over-scrupulous, and thus has lost the better part of his time and energy. These processes date from the days when man believed himself alone in the universe, confronted by innumerable enemies. Little by little he discovers that these innumerable enemies were but allies and mysterious slaves of man which had not been taught to serve him. Man, to-day, is on the point of realizing that everything around him begs to be allowed to come to his assistance, and is ever ready to work with him and for him, if he will but make his wishes understood. This glad message is daily spreading more widely through all the domains of human intelligence. The artist alone, moved by a sort of superannuated pride, has refused to listen to the modern voice. He reminds one of one of those unhappy solitary weavers, still to be found in remote parts of the country, who, though weighed down by the misery of poverty and useless fatigue, yet absolutely continues to weave coarse fabric by an antiquated and obsolete method, and this although but a few steps from his cabin are to be found the power of the torrent, of coal and of wind, which offer to do twenty times in one hour the work which cost him a long month of slavery, and to do it better. / It is already many years since the sun revealed to us its power to portray objects and beings more quickly and more accurately than can pencil or crayon. It seemed to work only its own way and at its own pleasure. At first man was restricted to making permanent that which the impersonal and unsympathetic light had registered. He had not yet been permitted to imbue it with thought. But to-day it sees that thought has found a fissure through which to penetrate the mystery of this anonymous force, invade it, subjugate it, animate it, and compel it to say such things as have not yet been said in all the realm of chiaroscuro, of grace, of beauty and of truth. / MAURICE MAETERLINCK""

"Drawing for Old Man from the Mountain Hut, 1953, Azechi Umetaro","This is the drawing for Old Man from the Mountain Hut. .Both prints display different colors, especially in the face of the old man, and neither print exhibits the same color choices as the drawing. Notice in the drawing that the positions of the figure’s fingers are not as they appear in the prints, though the new positions have been indicated on the drawing in pencil. Azechi Umetaro was an avid mountain climber, and his love for this pastime makes up the core of his subject matter.",7051.0,"Artist

"Bowl with Birds, Ilkhanid dynasty (1256–1353), late 13th/early 14th century, Islamic","This bowl belongs a group of ceramics known as Sultanabad wares, named after the city in western Iran. Although these wares were found in Sultanabad, their origins of production are not certain, but their decorative schemes often illustrate the conflation of Chinese and Iranian visual motifs. The phoenix, depicted three times here, is a common motif of Mongol ceramics. Like the lotus flower depicted on another Sultanabad ware, the phoenix was imported from China, although they both lacked imperial associations in their new Ilkhanid context. In medieval Iran, the phoenix was conflated with the mythical figure of the simurgh, a legendary bird from the epic poem, the Shahnameh (Book of Kings). Sultanabad wares are also distinguished by their hemispherical shape, which approximates the shape of Chinese celadon bowls. The muted brown-grey palette of this bowl reflects a color scheme found in many other Sultanabad vessels, but this bowl also shimmers iridescent under light.",7053.0,"Culture

"Old Tower at Avignon, c. 1875, Samuel Colman","Old Tower at Avignon depicts a 14th-century fortress in southern France. A noted colorist for his use of saturated hues, Samuel Colman captured the romance of the age-old structure amid sunlight, storm clouds, and reflections on the Rhône River. An accomplished landscapist, Colman began his career depicting New England scenery, as did his contemporaries among the Hudson River School, the dominant style of landscape painting in mid-19th-century America. After first going to Europe to study in 1860, Colman traveled extensively throughout his long career, traversing France, Italy, Spain, North Africa, Mexico, and the American West, among other destinations.",7060.0,"Artist

"Mirror with Jaguar or Coyote Mosaic, A.D. 500/600, Teotihuacan","For over 2,000 years, polished stone mirrors were an important component of Mesoamerican attire, ritual, and symbolic imagery. This mirror is made of a single sheet of polished pyrite stone and includes a jade jaguar mosaic at its center. Mirrors often functioned as emblems of rank and office and were typically worn at the small of the back. The depiction of such mirrors in ancient murals, as worn by warriors, priests, and state officials, attests to their importance in the spectacular art of ritual performance in Teotihuacan.",7074.0,"Culture

"Untitled (John-John and Bobby), 1988, Larry Johnson","Larry Johnson is an idiosyncratic artist whose signature style consists of graphic photographed collages that demonstrate his consuming passion for celebrity, advertising, and the cultures and subcultures of Southern California. Untitled (John-John and Bobby) is part of a series that Johnson began in 1985; centering on the Kennedy family, it demonstrates his interest not only in individual family members, but also in the era of American society and politics that they typify. This work consists of a fictional account by Johnson, which bears no connection to the Kennedy family other than the names and the reference in the first panel to “Kennedy half-dollars.” The disjointed story fragment includes a pornographic account of the hustler lifestyle and more broadly addresses how the media packages public figures and represents them as entertainment.",7079.0,"Artist

"Relief Plaque Depicting a God, Ptolemaic Period (305–30 BC), Ancient Egyptian","One way Egyptian artists expressed the concept of immortality was by repeating artistic conventions that had been used for thousands of years. One of the oldest such traditions was the simplification of the human body, which was reduced to its fundamental, most recognizable shape. Here the face is in profile, but the eye and the chest are depicted frontally. While these formal conventions continued to be honored after the Greeks came to rule Egypt during the Ptolemaic period, the new kings also imposed their own taste. The soft flesh of the face and the small, rounded nose are drawn from naturalistic Greek sculpture and are reminiscent of artworks seen at the court of the Ptolemies in the new capital of Alexandria.",7084.0,"Culture

"Between a Rock and a Hard Place, 2012, Kay Rosen","Kay Rosen uses words and letters as a means of examining the ways in which language structures knowledge, particularly, in terms of awareness of self and place. Painting is her primary medium; she has created modestly sized canvases, as well as expansive wall works and large, site-specific outdoor projects comprised exclusively of paint, color, and language. Between a Rock and a Hard Place depicts the word “KANDAHAR” in large, gray letters. On either side of KANDAHAR, two partial letters, cropped by the left and right edges, are visible: C on the left and D on the right. The title, however, illuminates what is missing. Kandahar is the name of a province in Afghanistan, as well as of the country’s second largest city. It is significant that the name of one of the world’s most conflicted terrains is contained within one of the most common aphorisms used to describe conflict.",7092.0,"Artist
