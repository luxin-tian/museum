"Combats and Triumphs: Battle of the Naked Men, 1550/1572, Étienne Delaune","In this delicately rendered engraving by Etienne Delaune, violence is often undercut by humorous moments. In the Battle of the Naked Men, one of the combatants bites into the leg of his enemy as if it is a sandwich. Delaune distinguished between combatants in the Battle of the Naked Men by giving one side New World adornments, adding a touch of the exotic to an otherwise traditional scene. The fine lines of the engraving allowed the artist to create quite a bit of detail on a small scale; even the overturned wine jug is decorated.",7101.0,"Artist

"Bachelor Girl, 1915, John Sloan","As the current exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity demonstrates, women in the late 19th century were regularly defined by their attire. Clothing, makeup, and accessories frequently reflected not only a woman’s social status but also her character and morality. Scholar Justine De Young has observed of the period, “Dressing fashionably and in good taste thus became one of the central concerns of a bourgeois woman’s daily life, as not merely her appearance but also her reputation was at stake.” The same strict rules of public presentation did not necessarily apply, however, to the private, domestic sphere—as the images in this gallery illustrate. Shown here are women in the process of dressing or undressing; relaxing in their underclothes, nightgowns, or morning dress; or in the most private of moments: sleeping or reclining nude. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s print portfolio Elles most likely depicts prostitutes during the course of the day, but these prints could easily represent the interior life of any woman, as they illustrate common boudoir behaviors: the toilette, lounging in bed, grooming, and conversing with friends. Prints by Childe Hassam, Edvard Munch, James McNeill Whistler, and Paul Gavarni show women wearing peignoirs or dressing gowns. These garments were typically worn by upper class women while they went about their regular morning activities: attending to the servants or the children, catching up on reading and correspondence, and other routine household concerns.",7109.0,"Artist

"Diana, Modeled 1889, cast after 1900, Frederick William MacMonnies","While studying in Paris, the young sculptor Frederick MacMonnies modeled a life-size plaster version of Diana for exhibition at the Paris Salon of 1889. The sculpture, a depiction of the Roman goddess of the hunt, won an honorable mention and assured his reputation as an important artist both in France and in the United States. Diana then proved so popular that he produced numerous reduced-sized replicas in bronze for American patrons. True to the Beaux-Arts ideals then current in France, MacMonnies included traditional symbols of the goddess such as the bow in her hand and the crescent moon in her hair, recalling classical precedent. However, his naturalistic rendering of the nude figure, modeled after the features of a young woman, has a lively grace that marks MacMonnies’s independence from strict neoclassical tradition.",7117.0,"Artist

"The Manger, 1899, Gertrude Käsebier","Married and the mother of three children, Gertrude Käsebier took up photography in her forties. She achieved success quickly: in 1898–99 Käsebier exhibited at the elite Philadelphia Photographic Salon, befriended the influential dealer and photographer Alfred Stieglitz, joined the Camera Club of New York, and opened her own studio. This photograph of a Nativity scene bolstered her reputation as a photographer: Stieglitz published it in his early journal Camera Notes and again in the opening issue of Camera Work, in which Käsebier was the featured artist. With its soft focus, rich tonality, deep emotional overtones, and classical source material, The Manger epitomizes the pictorialist aesthetic cultivated by fine art photographers of the period. Käsebier was praised for her heartfelt images of mothers and children, in which she created the appearance of unposed authenticity even with staged subjects. In this tender depiction, the model holds nothing more than a bundle of blankets.",7122.0,"Artist

"The Armoire, 1778, Jean Honoré Fragonard","The Rococo taste for narrative led the great painter and printmaker Jean-Honoré Fragonard to devote his largest etching to a risqué domestic drama. A young woman and her paramour have been interrupted in a compromising position by her parents. The rumpled state of the bedclothes alone would have roused their ire, but they have also discovered the young man hiding in their daughter’s closet. The mortified young man’s strategically positioned hat leaves both the parents and viewers in little doubt of his dishonorable intentions. The girl stands barefoot and weeping in the corner out of modesty and fear, unable to meet her furious parents’ gaze.",7130.0,"Artist

"From the Back-Window “291”, 1915, Alfred Stieglitz","Stieglitz took this photograph from the back window of the gallery 291, possibly inspired by the fractured, geometric canvases of the Cubist painters Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, the focus of an exhibition there just months earlier. Yet at the same time that Stieglitz was exploring modern art, he was also looking back to the 19th-century photographs of David Octavius Hill. He wrote to R. Child Bayley around that time, “I have done quite some photography recently. It is intensely direct. Portraits. Buildings from my back window at 291, a whole series of them, a few landscapes and interiors. All interrelated. I know nothing outside of Hill’s work which I think is so direct, and quite so intensely honest.”",7131.0,"Artist

"Barricade, 1918, George Wesley Bellows","In this scene, American realist painter George Bellows constructed a terrifying scenario of German World War I forces using naked civilians as human shields. Though he never saw war firsthand, Bellows’s engagement with the subject grew from documentary reports on the atrocities reported in the American press. Reportedly, this image and the one that accompanies it, Bacchanale, were both based on eyewitness accounts from the 1915 Bryce Report, which recorded hundreds of stories of the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914. The testimonies published in the Bryce Report’s 320-page Appendix A included some sensationalist accounts of mutilations and rapes for which there is no other evidence. The series War, which chronicled these crimes, consisted of 5 oil paintings, 20 lithographic prints, and more than 30 related drawings. In this image, the sharp Picklehauben helmets, heavy uniforms, and gleaming bayonet contrast with the soft vulnerability of exposed human flesh. The exaggeratedly large arms and hands of the victims, which are raised to the sky, call attention to their subjugation and acquiescence.",7141.0,"Artist
