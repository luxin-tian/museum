"Lasso, 2000, Salla Tykka","Although the characters and experiences that Salla Tykkä represents are fictionalized, her practice may be understood as self-portraiture. At the same time, the films in her Cave trilogy (2002–03), Lasso, Thriller, and Cave, skillfully distill cinematic genres such as the horror film or the western, drawing out social themes. Tykkä has commented, “In Lasso, I approached westerns, which I adored in my youth, their black-and-white set of values reminding me of the society I lived in. I was touched by the questions these films raised about power and by what kind of roles women played in these films and how.”
Lasso explores the passage from childhood to adulthood with a grand sensibility. The video begins as a jogger returns from a run in the suburbs of Helsinki, catching her breath as she approaches a front door. Ringing the bell and trying the locked door, she walks around to the back of the house, where she comes upon a series of full-length windows. At first, her reflection is seen in the pane, but as she approaches to peer through the Venetian blinds, the camera reveals the interior of the house. A young man, stripped to the waist and barefoot, is deep in concentration as he swings a lasso. The camera eventually returns to the woman, her eyes and tear-stained cheeks visible through the slats of the blinds.
The music for Lasso, equal parts poignant and farcical, is borrowed from composer Ennio Morricone’s Once Upon a Time in the West (1969), a selection that equates this classic “spaghetti” western with the faux rodeo antics of Tykkä’s male protagonist. Coupled with his graceful movements, the mise-en-scène hypnotically draws viewers into the same trance the female character has fallen under. This spell is broken when the young man falls to his knees and forcefully crashes the lasso against the floor, at which point the jogger backs slowly away from the window, leaving behind a trace of her breath on the glass.
According to Tykkä, the original script for Lasso was “a story about a young woman in whose everyday life subconscious visions intrude, shattering her reality into pieces.” The film focuses on what is seemingly a fragment of a much larger narrative.",7151.0,"Artist

"Belt (Yeemy Mambolmashet), 19th century, Kuba","In the Kuba Kingdom, ceremonial occasions require ostentatious displays of wealth and status through dress and other attributes. Specialized male artists excel in the making of beaded regalia like the belt displayed here. They sew both beads and shells onto a woven raffia foundation to create geometric designs. The interlaced pattern on this belt, called imbol, is a favorite Kuba motif that can also be seen on the raffia skirts worn with such beaded ornaments.",7152.0,"Culture

Sullivan","In 1922 a small group of friends and colleagues worked with the Art Institute to commission a series of drawings from Louis Sullivan illustrating his philosophy of architectural ornament. Completed in the last year of his life, this project—an essay and twenty detailed plates—explores Sullivan’s belief that ornament was the consummate expression of the architect’s intellect and creative freedom, ideas that would have a great impact on the next generation of architects in Chicago. This publication is now understood as one of the most influential statements on modern architecture ever produced.",7160.0,"Artist

"Solidus (Coin) of Theophilus, AD 829/831, Byzantine","As powerful vehicles for propaganda, Byzantine coins also emphasized the close relationship between earthly monarchs and the heavenly realm, as does this solidus of Theophilus (r. 829-842). A bust-length portrait of the emperor appears on the obverse; he wears a crown and is garbed in the imperial loros, a heavily jeweled stole for festive occasions. In his hands are a globe and a scepter, both of which are surmounted by crosses. The patriarchal cross above three steps that appears on the reverse is meant to represent a large cross that was erected in the fourth century on the site of Christ’s crucifixion in Jerusalem. This motif of a cross and steps was first used on the coins of Tiberius II (r. 578-82), and its increasing popularity reflected the progressive Christianizing of imperial iconography, in which symbols such as the cross replaced earlier pagan elements like winged Victories.",7171.0,"Culture

"Solidus (Coin) of Theophilus, AD 829/831, Byzantine","The imagery of Byzantine coins, as well as their use—or not—of religious imagery, reflects the different attitudes toward representation of divine figures as a result of the Iconoclastic (from the Greek eikon, or image, and klao, to break) Controversy, a fierce debate among Byzantine theologians over the appropriate role of images in religious worship that raged in Byzantium for over 100 years from about 730 to 843.
Theophilus, the last imperial proponent of Iconoclasm, follows the examples of Heraclius (r. 610–41) and Leontius (r. 695–98) before him by linking his portrait on the front of this coin with a potent visual symbol of Christ, the monumental cross on four steps that had been erected at Jerusalem in the fourth century.",7171.0,"Culture

"Conical Bowl with Blossoming Plum, Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279)","This bowl’s striking, variegated blue hue was created accidentally during firing, when the iron-rich glaze chemically reacted with a mixture of wood or bamboo ash that was applied to its surface. The original dark brown hue is preserved in the more thinly coated rim and in the hauntingly delicate pattern of blossoming plum that was applied in resist by a stencil of cut paper. As the first flower to bloom in late winter, the plum blossom was associated with beauty, renewal, and fortitude, and became an auspicious motif in Chinese painting and decorative arts during the Song dynasty.",7180.0,"Title
