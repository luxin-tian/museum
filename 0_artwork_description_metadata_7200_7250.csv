"Racehorse: The Jockeys - Eddie Arcaro, c. 1957, Robert Riger","An illustrator, photographer, cinematographer, and television director, Robert Riger was one of the most acclaimed visual interpreters of sports in his day. Hugh Edwards championed his work, mounting two shows of his photographs (on football, in 1962, and the racetrack, in 1964) and hosting a massive exhibition, Man in Sport, organized by Riger. This photograph is from the racetrack series, which showcased horses, trainers, jockeys, and owners; the museum acquired 20 of these the year that they were shown. Edwards praised Riger’s “abstracts of rounded and rhythmical gesture,” demonstrated here as the horse’s legs blur in motion while the jockey remains forever concentrated and stilled.",7201.0,"Artist

"Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Vespasian, 75/79, issued by Vespasian, Ancient Roman","In A.D. 68 the chaotic reign of the Roman emperor Nero came to an end with his forced suicide, but what followed was an equally chaotic struggle to succeed him. The support of the army was critical: the year A.D. 69 saw one general after another claim the throne only to be killed by one of his rivals. Finally, the Roman army in Egypt joined the army in Syria to back General Vespasian. Knowing that Egypt was the empire’s breadbasket, Vespasian’s first effort as emperor was to pacify and control this important province. The armor he wears on this coin emphasizes his role as a warrior king.",7215.0,"Culture

"Trouble, 1989, Christopher Wool","Christopher Wool’s compositions explore the intersection between signage and language, pattern and decoration. His painting method involves the use of commercially produced stamps, screens, rollers, and stencils to ironically achieve “allover” surfaces. In 1987 he began making “word paintings,” canvases consisting of single words and phrases—often with irregular spacing and line breaks—in block letters with visible drips and other handmade imperfections. Trouble belongs to a series of paintings of pointedly four-letter words, such as fear, riot, and amok, in which Wool stacked the letters two by two. Here the vowels have been deleted, shortening trouble to optimize its graphic, visual impact. Wool’s paintings are typically black-and-white; this variation is thus unique within the artist’s practice.",7224.0,"Artist

"The Steerage, 1907, printed 1920/39, Alfred Stieglitz","Alfred Stieglitz shot this photograph in 1907, during a voyage by ocean liner to Europe; it was years, however, before he and others in his circle came to recognize it as a defining work of modernism, showing that photography could transcend its ostensible subject to depict deeper emotions. He later described the moment when, desperate to escape the stuffy upper classes, he looked down to the steerage level: “I saw shapes related to each other. I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I had about life.”",7229.0,"Artist

"Alexander Kneeling before Jaddus at the Gates of Jerusalem [left section], from The Story of Alexander the Great, c. 1600, Nicolaas van Orley","Numerous Flemish tapestry sets depicting stories from the life of Alexander the Great (r. 336–323 b.c.) survive from the 16th and 17th centuries, attesting to the popularity of the subject. This scene depicts the story of Alexander’s conversion to Judaism. After successful military campaigns in Syria and Gaza, Alexander led his armies to Jerusalem to conquer the city. In a dream, God told Jaddus, the high priest of the Jews, to open the gates of the city to the conqueror. The people of Jerusalem welcomed Alexander and in turn were spared.",7232.0,"Artist
