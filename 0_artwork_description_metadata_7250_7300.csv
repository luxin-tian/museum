"Rock-Cut Temple, December 30, 1925, Paul Klee","A professor at the Bauhaus from 1920 to 1933, Klee often experimented with the systemic use of line. One of Klee’s favored theories, that of the distinction between form and formation through the use of line, is demonstrated here. In this drawing, parallel lines create new architectural structures, highlighting the formative power of the artist and his line. For Klee, the end result, the form, was not important; the act of creation and the limitless possibilities of line were what mattered.",7250.0,"Artist

"Headcloth, 1000/1476, Chancay","With its delicacy of thread and complex construction, this extraordinary head cloth exemplifies Chancay gauze weaving, often considered the finest among all of the ancient Peruvian textile traditions. The repeated off-set rows of fish motifs—each outlined with softly spun cotton stitching—strongly evoke a school of fish caught within a fisherman’s net. Coastal cultures such as the Chancay embraced marine life in many forms, especially the bounty it provided as a source of food.",7251.0,"Culture

"Garment Hook, Eastern Zhou dynasty (770–221 B.C.)","The buttonlike knob on the back of this small garment hook served to fasten a belt or robe. A dragon of jade curls sinuously within its bronze mount—a composite creature combining a bull’s head and a serpentine body terminating in a fishlike tail curled over one horn. The dragon’s finely incised curls are echoed in a complex pattern of gold and silver embellishing the mount. Thin strands of these malleable metals, applied individually or compacted together into thicker ribbons, were pressed into grooves in the bronze, then ground flush with the surface and polished to a high luster. This combination of descriptive and abstract patterns—facial features, scales, volutes, and spirals—is a masterwork of metallic inlay.",7252.0,"Title

"The Morris Dancers, n.d., Israhel van Meckenem, the younger","The Morris Dance is a folk dance still practiced in England today. Here the roundel shape of Meckenem’s engraving echoes the pattern of the cavorting dancers, as they encircle a young woman holding a ring. The poses are intentionally exaggerated, especially that of the fool at left. The dance, which may have originated in medieval Spain, was a popular court spectacle, as the merry throng of onlookers at the window suggests.",7260.0,"Artist

"The Raising of Lazarus: The Larger Plate, c. 1632, Rembrandt van Rijn","The preeminent Dutch painter and printmaker Rembrandt van Rijn often revisited this important biblical subject, in which Christ foreshadows his own death and resurrection by reviving the dead Lazarus. The artist produced several versions of this scene from different vantage points. In this dramatic, arched composition, both the viewer and the onlookers wait inside the burial cave. Christ turns his back to the viewer, and as he raises one hand in a ray of blinding light, Lazarus begins to emerge from his grave.",7266.0,"Artist

"Out of Blue, 2002, Zarina Bhimji","Zarina Bhimji’s Out of Blue captures nuanced impressions of presentday Uganda, where the artist lived as a child. For Bhimji, however, the film transcends biographical concerns. She explained, ""The work is not a personal indulgence; it is about making sense through the medium of aesthetics."" In the opening scene, a crackle of flames erupts into an allencompassing fire that overtakes an expansive, verdant landscape. This destructive, yet mesmerizing blaze acts as a dynamic formal element that sets the tone of the film. Intermingled with sweeping views of a picturesque countryside are lingering shots of empty locations imbued with memory and loss—disused refugee dwellings, cemeteries, prison cells, and schoolyards—evoking both British colonial rule and the repressive military dictatorship of Idi Amin, during which thousands of Asians were expelled from the country. Matching the intense visual detail of the film is the artist’s richly layered soundtrack, in which ambient sounds from nature—mosquitoes buzzing, bird wings flapping—are punctuated with distant gunshots, chaotic voices, excerpts from General Amin’s radio announcements, and a woman’s sobs. Viewed as an open-ended, aesthetic engagement with the processes of looking and understanding, Out of Blue is neither memoir nor protest. According to Bhimji, ""My work is about learning to listen to difference in its various forms… . It is not about capturing an existing thing; it is about creating a new one.""",7273.0,"Artist

"Fragment of a Portrait Statue of a Man, Perhaps a Roman Emperor, late 1st/early 2nd century AD, Ancient Roman","The unidentified man in this over-life-size headless portrait statue is dressed in full military regalia. His torso is covered with a body armor called a cuirass, the front side of which is adorned with figural motifs intended to ward off evil. His armor is worn over a long tunic that ends above his knees and a leather, vest-like garment with tasseled straps to protect his groin and shoulders. He wears a type of heavy cloak, typically worn by Roman military commanders, draped over his left shoulder. Without the carved head, which would have been made separately and attached, it is impossible to identify the individual represented in this portrait. The elaborate ceremonial armor suggests that he was a general or perhaps even the emperor, as the latter held the role of commander of the Roman army.",7282.0,"Culture

"Untitled, 1923, Max Herman Maxy","By the early 1920s Berlin had become a crossroads for the international avant-garde, especially for artists from Eastern Europe, who were eager to absorb the radical art of their time and find opportunities to exhibit and sell their work. Max Herman Maxy arrived in 1922, already well established in the modern art scene of Romania but eager for more direct exposure to the dynamism of Berlin’s artistic life. Maxy was soon associated with the Expressionist Novembergruppe (November Group) as well as the art dealer Herwarth Walden, who featured the artist’s work in his publication Der Sturm and at his Sturm Galerie. This composition reflects the Expressionist influences on Maxy’s work: the vibrant, prismatic facets describe the shallow surfaces of buildings as well as the darkened space of narrow alleys, which together produce a lively, kaleidoscopic effect.",7283.0,"Artist

"Still Life in Stanley Mitruk’s Studio, 1951/55, Harold Allen","The noted architectural photographer Harold Allen taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from the 1940s through the 1970s. While his passion was the photographic documentation of America’s architectural heritage (often accompanied by his own original research), in this photograph he attentively recorded porcelain and glass objects in the State Street studio of Chicago artist Stanley Mitruk. Mitruk employed these objects in several still lifes, including a painting purchased by Allen the following year. Recognizing Allen’s talent for documentary photography, Hugh Edwards exhibited his work in 1966 and encouraged him to publish Father Ravalli’s Missions in 1972, a portfolio of two early mission churches in Montana and Idaho.",7285.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1854, Edouard Denis Baldus","Initially trained as a painter, Édouard-Denis Baldus turned to photography in the late 1840s and quickly gained recognition. In 1851 the French government selected him as one of five photographers to document the nation’s architectural heritage, a survey known as the Missions Héliographiques. The images Baldus produced for the project exhibited such technical prowess that he won support for another project, Les villes de France photographiées, designed to revive interest in the nation’s Roman and medieval history. During the summer of 1854, Baldus traveled in the Auvergne region of central France, making pictures that emphasize the drama of the natural landscape, such as this river scene. Although the large-format waxed paper negatives he employed were never intended to be exhibited, they remain compelling objects that offer up a startling range of tones.",7294.0,"Artist
