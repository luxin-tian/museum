"Cinerary Urn of Plautia Hesperis, 1st century AD, Ancient Roman","Prior to A.D. 100, the Romans typically cremated their dead and placed the ashes and remaining bones in urns and ossuaries (containers used to hold skeletal remains). The front of this urn is adorned with heart-shaped ivy leaves and an inscription that identifies the deceased, a young woman named Plautia Hesperis. Much like modern headstones, the inscription indicates the length of her life (“Lived 16 years”). The lid is adorned with simple rosettes at the corners, while an eagle, thought by the Romans to carry the deceased’s soul into the realm of the gods, is perched at its center.",7302.0,"Culture

"Corner Cabinet, c. 1785, Jean Henri Riesener","This corner was one of four made for the dining room of Marie Antoinette’s private retreat, which was built within the Petit Trianon complex on the grounds of Versailles. The retreat, a cluster of picturesque buildings including a mill, dairy and working farm, was known as Le Hameau, or The Hamlet. The marks painted and impressed on top of the cabinet, underneath the marble slab, indicate that it was made for the French queen.",7303.0,"Artist

"Corner Cabinet, c. 1785, Jean Henri Riesener","In keeping with the back-to-nature movement in vogue during the 1780s, Marie Antoinette commissioned this village, whose deliberately distressed buildings with quaint thatched roofs belied the luxurious furnishings often contained within. This retreat into a make-believe world of simple pleasures gave the queen the opportunity to escape from the rigid protocol of French court life with her closest friends.",7303.0,"Artist

"Corner Cabinet, c. 1785, Jean Henri Riesener","The corner cabinet, with its imported mahogany veneers, marble top, and jewel-like gilt-bronze mounts, was designed by Jean-Henri Riesener (1734–1806), the most important cabinetmaker working in Paris at the time. Like many others in his field, Riesener was of German origin. He specialized in sophisticated marquetry and an interpretation of the fashionable Neoclassical style that had become increasingly delicate by the time this cupboard was made. The horizontal gilt-bronze border of semi-recumbent infants and leafy garlands below the marble top are especially finely cast.",7303.0,"Artist

"And they are like wild beasts, plate five from The Disasters of War, 1812/15, published 1863, Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes","Even mothers are driven to violence, as this image depicts. A woman holds a child on her left hip, even as she thrusts a spear into a French soldier with her right arm. In the background, other women assault the enemy by various means or languish from their wounds. The striking juxtaposition of the maternal with violent aggression serves to communicate the desperate conditions of the Peninsular War.",7330.0,"Artist

"Church Lady, 1933/37, William Edmondson","One of the most significant self-taught artists of the 1930s and 1940s, William Edmondson said that God had commanded him to begin carving tombstones. He later turned to figural subjects, both religious and secular, which reflect the artist’s spirituality and the values of the African American society in which he lived. Church Lady is one of several sculptures Edmondson carved of recognizable types of mature women from his Nashville, Tennessee, community. The figure’s identity is suggested by her decorous, stylish outfit: a long coat worn over a dress with a bow at the neck and a close-fitting, tilted hat featuring a snood. In one hand she holds a small purse; in the other she clutches a Bible. Edmondson achieved fame in 1937 when he became the first black artist to be given a retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Many saw important parallels in his work to the direct carving movement then popular among modernist sculptors.",7332.0,"Artist

"Some Thames - Group C, 2000, Roni Horn","This selection of framed photographs belongs to a series of 80 different images that comprise Some Thames, which depicts the surface of the Thames River in central London. These works extend Roni Horn’s larger, serial investigation into the visual, literary, and metaphoric possibilities of water. The artist stated: “Some Thames is literally the idea of a finite thing having an infinite range of appearance or expression because of its inseparable relation to other things.” The Thames—alternately transparent and opaque, violent and still, pastoral and urban, cleansing and dirty—offers a range of broad metaphors for an understanding of self. Some Thames, like most of Horn’s work, is an abstracted self-portrait. Self, like this river, is transcendently fluid, ultimately unknowable.",7340.0,"Artist

"The Tomb of a Bishop, 1540/45, Battista dell’ Angolo del Moro","During the Counter-Reformation, the sense of touch influenced religious experience as much as if not more than sight. In this etching of a bishop’s elaborate sculptural resting place, the sorrowing putti embrace the effigy of the deceased and weave their hands and arms in and out of holes in the base of the sarcophagus. Parmigianino’s elongated bodies accentuate the tactility of the composition and contribute to the composition’s emotional resonance. While the bishop’s identity remains unknown (and he may have been imaginary), the monumentality of his sepulchre and the relief panel below showing his investiture hint at his historical importance.",7342.0,"Artist

"Royal Chair (Asipim), Late 19th/early 20th century, Asante","Within Asante society, asipim chairs signal the power and prestige of chiefs, who have the unique right to use them. The asipim’s low profile reflects the Asante preference for stools as seats of honor, while its shape and the decorative use of brass tacks, knobs, and finials document the assimilation of European forms and materials in the 18th and 19th centuries. The finely delineated motifs pressed into the brass covering the back of this chair refer to the owner’s status.",7349.0,"Culture
