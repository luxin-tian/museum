"Bust from the Adams Memorial, Modeled 1892–93, cast 1912, Augustus Saint-Gaudens","This bust comes from the upper portion of Augustus Saint-Gaudens’s 1886–91 full-figure tomb monument for Marian Hooper Adams, the wife of historian and philosopher Henry Adams, in Washington’s Rock Creek Cemetery. Because Marian’s death was a suicide and the couple was fascinated by Asian cultures, Henry asked Saint-Gaudens to avoid Christian symbolism and instead evoke the “contemplative compassion derived from Buddhist philosophy.” When Chicago architect Daniel Burnham visited Saint-Gaudens in 1892, he saw a plaster cast of the figure’s head and was enthralled by its mysterious yet meditative quality. In 1893, perhaps in celebration of Chicago’s World’s Columbian Exposition, Saint-Gaudens gave the bust to Burnham, who later had four bronzes cast from it.",7355.0,"Artist

"Running Horse Weather Vane, c. 1860, Alvin L. Jewell","Before the advent of modern mechanized devices, weather vanes were an important source of information on shifting weather conditions. The horse shape was common; in fact, weather vanes often memorialized famous racehorses. The elegant simplicity of this example is characteristic of the works of Alvin L. Jewell, one of the most important 19th-century weather vane designers. At his metal manufacturing firm, A. L. Jewell and Company, Jewell invented a molding process so that he could mass-produce his handcrafted work. In this example, Jewell made the head of a solid, heavier metal, so the weather vane would balance properly and point toward the wind’s source. Jewell’s innovative manufacturing and advertising methods helped to change the growing American weather vane industry.",7356.0,"Artist

"Work Table, c. 1880, Maison Alphonse Giroux","The innovative marquetry technique displayed on this work table, was patented in 1877 by Rosalie Duvinage, also called Veuve (Widow) Duvinage. She was the owner of Maison Giroux, a Paris firm that had produced a wide assortment of luxury goods for generations. In this mosaic technique, pieces of ivory were held fast within a matrix of engraved metal strips and different woods were inlaid to create complex patterns. Here the ivory ground is separated by a network of engraved brass and pewter that forms the branches and leaves of a flowering peony bush, within which rests a large pheasant. Different wood inlays reveal the contour and shading of both plant and bird.",7362.0,"Artist

"Work Table, c. 1880, Maison Alphonse Giroux","The decoration of this table was inspired by the flood of imports coming from Asia, especially from China and Japan, to Europe in the second half of the 19th century. Images of flowers and animals that were originally Chinese were adapted by Japanese craftsmen for furniture and finally translated onto objects in Europe. The artists of Maison Giroux appear to have had a firm grasp on the symbolic language of Asia: according to custom, tree peonies represent the male principle yang, and the golden pheasant (a traditional symbol of feminine beauty) symbolizes yin, its natural complement.",7362.0,"Artist

"The Street, 1964, Romare Howard Bearden","“The Street” is from Romare Bearden’s early “Projections” series, which documents the artist’s childhood in North Carolina and his migration to Harlem. These works began as small collages made with newspaper and magazine clippings, photographs, and paint, which were then enlarged using the Photostat copy process—which allowed Bearden to create large–scale reproductions on gelatin silver paper. Speaking later of the series, Bearden said, “What I’ve attempted to do is establish a world through art in which the validity of my Negro experience could live and make its own logic… . The medium I used was chosen intentionally because assemblage forges a variety of contrary images into one unified expression.",7373.0,"Artist

"Portrait of the Poet Hagiwara Sakutaro (1886–1942), Author of “Ice Island,” 1943, 1943, Onchi Koshiro","This portrait was done as a tribute to Hagiwara Sakutaro one year after the poet’s death. The dark tones and wrinkled skin of the subject make for a disturbing image, which is in keeping with Hagiwara’s tendency toward depression brought on by the realities of war. This portrait has been hailed as one of the most powerful prints produced by a 20th-century Japanese artist, and several other editions were later printed in 1949 and 1987.
Included on this finished print are Onchi Koshiro’s notes on the printing process to his fellow artist Sekino Junichiro. The additional set of prints shows the steps involved in attaining the completed image that Sekino printed from blocks made by his mentor.",7382.0,"Artist

"Container for Gold Dust, Snuff, or Tobacco (Adakawa), Mid–/late 19th century, Akan-speaking peoples","It is difficult to determine the intended use of this Akan container, which is made from alloyed copper impressed with decorative motifs, including a European merchant ship and a steam locomotive. In medium and decoration, it resembles a forowa, a lidded vessel used for storing shea-butter, a type of vegetable oil. There are, however, salient differences between this container and a forowa. This work is significantly smaller than most forowa, measuring only three inches in length and barely an inch in diameter. Its lid is also connected to the container by a chain, which is not true of forowa. The container’s diminutive size makes it unlikely to have been used as a shea-butter container. Instead it probably served to hold snuff or pipe tobacco. In addition, the quality of craftsmanship of the piece is exceptionally high, exhibiting straight lines and broad grooves that suggest mass production.
Iconographically, too, this container differs significantly from the typical Akan forowa in its inordinate emphasis on elements of European material culture. The embossed locomotive and sailing boat are clear pointers to the likely European origin of the imagery of the piece, as they are to its possible date. The inclusion of the locomotive engine dates the piece to after 1829, when that invention was first recorded. It is possible that this container was classified together with European manufactured items, such as staffs, hats, walking sticks, and a variety of personal items that were presented to influential Africans by European visitors and residents as tokens of alliance. Gifts that changed hands between Africans and Europeans enhanced commercial and political relations. In the hands of its African owner, this lidded container would have constituted a prestige symbol. Such an artifact would have served simultaneously as a signifier of wealth and an emblem of status for its Akan owner.",7388.0,"Culture
