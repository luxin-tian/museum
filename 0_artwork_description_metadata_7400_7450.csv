"Tea and Coffee Service, 1809/12, Jean-Simon Chaudron","Born in France, Jean-Simon Chaudron emigrated to Haiti in 1780, where he lived for thirteen years, before moving with his new wife to Philadelphia. By 1799 he was established as a silversmith and formed a partnership with Anthony Rasch, a Bavarian immigrant who had trained as a silversmith in Germany, in 1809. Utilizing technical advances that developed during the first decades of the nineteenth century, Chaudron and Rasch were able to produce a number of objects using many of the same decorative motifs. Together, the artisans created some of the most ambitious neoclassical silver in America, taking many of their decorative elements from French and English silver designs from the early nineteenth century, as well as motifs from Greek mythology.",7410.0,"Artist

in about 1652. In this print, the plundering troops inspect the dead or dying on an unspecified battlefield. It was extolled by the 20th-century English etcher Walter Sickert as ""perhaps the etching of the world … for clarity, concision and vivacity.""",7412.0,"Artist

"Big School Picture; Little Paper Mural, 1992, Gladys Nilsson","Attending SAIC in the early 1960s, Gladys Nilsson studied with and befriended the art history professor Whitney Halstead. Among the most celebrated watercolorists working today, Nilsson builds her compositions by applying thin layers of transparent wash, resulting in great depth and brilliant colors. This watercolor depicting crowds of students across multiple spaces was originally commissioned by SAIC to be used as an advertising poster. The work is filled with her typically dense groupings of figures, organized lyrically and playfully within the composition.",7418.0,"Artist

"Tree and Sea, Maine, 1919, John Marin","Here Marin emphasized the colors, shapes, and textures that differentiate the various pines found along the Maine coast. A particularly gnarled, distorted tree moves with the frenetic energy of a dancer, while its companions rattle and sway in the breeze. Marin combined his hieroglyphic mark making with a carefully orchestrated color palette: rays of yellow sun warm the horizon, while touches of bright red-orange lead the eye into space. Again defying tradition, he used charcoal wash to darken and muddy the red tones of the clustered trees in the middle ground. He painted over heavy charcoal lines, smearing the particles to create a dark haze. Juxtaposing complexity of line with an unusually direct application of color, the artist captured a sensation of life in motion that is joyful, almost spiritual.",7420.0,"Artist

"The Green Sea – Movement – Stonington, Maine, 1921, John Marin","An early instance of Marin’s changing framing aesthetic can be seen in his handling of this watercolor, which was adhered to a gilded mount and then fitted in a spare gilded frame. This approach, which left plenty of space around the sheet, emphasizes the artwork’s materiality, an important concept for Marin. Unlike the white enamel frames he had favored throughout the previous decade, his gilded mounts and frames of the early 1920s were not intended to harmonize with his art. Rather, the use of gold was meant to be visually jarring, here drawing the viewer into the violent sea and proving the strength of the composition.",7432.0,"Artist

"Man Lying Down, Subway Steps, 1965, Roy DeCarava","In 1952, Roy DeCarava became the first African American photographer to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship. In his application, the chronicler of Harlem stated, “I want to show the strength, the wisdom, the dignity of the Negro people. Not the famous and the well known, but the unknown and the unnamed, thus revealing the roots from which springs the greatness of all human beings.” In pursuit of this goal, DeCarava frequently photographed people during their commute in New York City’s subway stations. Here, however, he presented an ambiguous moment: a man rests on the subway steps, suggesting vagrancy, a fall, or some other unknown circumstance. DeCarava increased the illegibility of the image by shooting from an odd vantage point and—as was his preference—by using only the limited available light, lending the scene an eerie, shadowy cast.",7437.0,"Artist

The painting prominently features the cup, along with other objects that were being recorded for posterity. In much the same way as we might videotape items in our home to make a record for an insurance company, the painting records the cup’s existence, as does the will of Whitfield’s grandson (also named John Whitfield), which details the items in the painting: “a large medal of the King of Sweden, his mother’s locket of diamonds in three parts, his grandfather’s sealed ring, his stricking [sic] watch, the Estrich [sic] cup, and Queen Elizabeth’s Glass, which was his grandfather’s.",7442.0,"Artist

"Denarius (Coin) Portraying King Ancus Marcius, 56 BC, issued by L. Marcius Philippus, Ancient Roman","Portraits of important people appear on local currency all around the world. The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BC. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person—Julius Caesar—appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire. In the mid-50s BC, it became common to portray ancestors that reinforced an important family lineage. The politician Lucius Marcius Philippus, who commissioned this coin, traced his lineage to the legendary King Ancus Marcius, who was believed to have lived in the late seventh century BC.",7445.0,"Culture
