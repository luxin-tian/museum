"Portrait of Jean-Baptiste Antoine Le Moyne, 1747, Jean-Baptiste Perronneau","Jean Baptiste Perronneau was one of the most unique portraitists in oil or pastel of the eighteenth century. He worked throughout Europe and Russia, but died a pauper in Holland. One of his most compelling early works is this pastel portrait, exhibited in the Salon of 1747, of the eldest son of his friend the sculptor Jean Baptiste Le Moyne the Younger. In this animated expression of youth, Perronneau used green shading to attain a naturalistic, lively face. The little boy, Jean Baptiste Antoine Le Moyne (1742-1781), grew up to be a judge, counselor to the king, and lieutenant in the Admiralty in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.",7451.0,"Artist

"The Star of the Kings: A Night Piece, c. 1651, Rembrandt van Rijn","Rembrandt likely knew Jan van de Velde the Younger’s dark yet straightforward rendition of the Twelfth Night festivities, in which the artist bathed his star-singers in sufficient lantern light so that their features could be made out. In contrast, Rembrandt submerged his revelers in pitch blackness, with only a glimmer of light emanating from their star. Carrying it was an important role (here assumed by a child), and at the end of each verse, pulling a rope set the star in motion. Rembrandt suggested a second group of singers in the far left, clustered around their own tiny, bright star.",7455.0,"Artist

"After a Flash Flood, Rancho Mirage, California, July 1979, July 1979, printed September 1987, Joel Sternfeld","Just as color photography was coming into its own as a medium for art, Joel Sternfeld started his career dedicated to using color film. In the late 1960s he made a major aesthetic shift by transitioning from images of life on the streets captured with a handheld camera to studies of the American landscape taken with a large-format view camera. In 1978 a Guggenheim grant allowed Sternfeld to embark on a nearly decade-long project that began as a drive across the United States. His photographic Wanderjahr, which echoed those of Walker Evans in the 1930s and Robert Frank in the 1950s, yielded the 1987 publication American Prospects, the contents of which the Art Institute owns in its entirety. After a Flash Flood, Rancho Mirage, California, July 1979 is typical of photographs in that book, many replete with details that take time to register fully, such as the comparison between a more visible car that sits calmly parked and another, destroyed, that lies overturned and embedded in the underside of a largely beige-to-brown landscape. Sternfeld uses color here and often to add layers of emotional complexity to seemingly straightforward images.",7465.0,"Artist

"Kah-Kap-Tee, 1898, Elbridge Ayer Burbank","In 1897 the Chicago artist Elbridge Ayer Burbank traveled west on behalf of his uncle, the philanthropist Edward E. Ayer, to paint a portrait of the famed Apache chief Geronimo, who was then living in captivity at Fort Sill in the Oklahoma territory. During his subsequent travels throughout the West, Burbank depicted individuals from numerous Native American tribes in ethnographic portraits, nevertheless focusing a sensitive artistic eye on his sitters. Like Hermon Atkins MacNeil before him, Burbank witnessed the Hopi Snake Dance in Arizona and followed the dance’s nine-day progress, ultimately producing more than 19 paintings of the participants. The Art Institute owns eight of these portraits. Each element of paint and dress carries a specific meaning in Burbank’s portraits. In his depictions of the Hopi priests Ko-Pe-Ley and Ho-Mo-Vi, for example, the black paint on the upper parts of their faces represents heavy rain clouds, and the white around their mouths stands for purity and faith. Eagle feathers, used in the ceremony to soothe the snakes, adorn their hair. Thus costumed, the priests would have removed the snakes from a special bag and placed the reptiles crosswise in their mouths. Despite his slightly loose brushwork, Burbank carefully depicted the priests’ ceremonial garb, giving his images anthropological authenticity as well as aesthetic power. He inscribed each portrait with the sitter’s name and tribal affiliation, using ""Moqui,"" an obsolete term for the Hopi people that is now considered offensive.",7487.0,"Artist

"Pictograph, c. 1944, Adolph Gottlieb","In 1941 Adolph Gottlieb began a series of paintings, prints, and drawings that he called Pictographs. These represent the artist’s first efforts at reconciling elements of abstraction with an exploration of the unconscious drawn from Surrealism. His aim was to create a new, uniquely American expression that would bring significant content to abstraction. The ideas Gottlieb explored in his Pictographs were so varied and complex that the series occupied him for more than 10 years. This print was created in the course of Gottlieb’s intensive exploration of the theme.",7488.0,"Artist

"Color Intersection M-II, Heisei period (1989–present), 1997, Shigeko Kubota","Shigeo Kubota was born in 1947 in the Nishijin district of Kyoto. He did his post-graduate work at the Kyoto City University of Arts, and today he is a professor at Seian College of Art and Design. Kubota exhibited his work extensively in Tokyo and Kyoto during the early 1970s, as well as in Switzerland, where he consistently partook in the Lausanne Biennial until it came to an end in 1995. He has also been included in 50 international group exhibitions in the United States, Australia, Poland, and Mexico.
Kubota’s use of color, technique, and material, with which he creates shapes and forms that occupy space in a very personal way, defines his art. He described his work as “the echo of opposites, the harmony of contrast. Humorous and profound, comical with desolate, desolate with beautiful, moving through space and time.”
Kubota was greatly influenced by American fiber art during his early career, specifically by artists like Ed Rossbach, Lenore Tawney, Claire Zeisler, and Sheila Hicks—all of whom are part of the Art Institute’s textile collection. In the piece Color Intersection M-ll, which he designed and executed in 1997, the artist introduced a piece dominated by gradations of color that were weft-resist dyed in a very simple composition of folded and twisted bands in plain weave. These bands were subsequently attached to a solid plane made from a sheet of heavy Plexiglas. The 32 elements in this horizontal composition are reminiscent of an accordion. Kubota’s art tends to be three-dimensional but hung on a two-dimensional plane—the wall.
Today the artist’s work appears in the following public collections: Museum Bellerieve, Zurich, Switzerland; The Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth; and The Cleveland Museum of Art; as well as a number of prominent private collections in Kyoto.",7498.0,"Artist
