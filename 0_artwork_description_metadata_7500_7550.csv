"Self-Portrait, 1917, Max Beckmann","Beckmann’s 1917 self-portrait reflects his despair during the later war years. According to the inscription he added in the upper-right corner, this brooding image was drawn at four o’clock in the morning. The artist’s deep-set, blankly staring eyes are strangely quiet and contemplative compared to his quivering handling of the medium.",7502.0,"Artist

"Jar with Handles, c. 2000 B.C.","Some of the oldest pottery in the world has been found in Japan. Although the country’s population was made up of hunters and gatherers during the Jomon period (12,500–300 B.C.), there was a stable pattern of settlements, making pottery production a possibility. The Jomon (literally “cord-mark decoration”) period is characterized by low-fired earthenware pottery with indentation marks, raised patterns, and sometimes flamboyant sculptural elements on the rims; such vessels can be found in regions across the Japanese archipelago. Those works displaying a highly refined artistic sense may have served ceremonial functions.
This open-work decorated jar is of the Ubayama (Kasori E) type found in the Neolithic shell mounds of Ichikawa in Chiba; this vessel type is characterized by integration of ornamentation and form, and an increasingly complex manner of patterning clay. Here double-lined “waves” made from coils of clay surge toward one of the perforated handles. The lower walls were impressed with a twisted cord.",7507.0,"Title

"Interior of Church, Tepotzotlán, Mexico, 1924, Tina Modotti","Tina Modotti learned photography from her mentor and lover, Edward Weston, with whom she lived in Mexico for several years in the 1920s. During that time, the pair would often photograph together, and produced still lifes, portraits of friends and locals, nudes, and architectural studies notable for their graphic clarity. This photograph of the interior of a church was made on a visit to Tepotzotlán during Holy Week in April 1924. In his Daybooks, Weston noted Modotti’s satisfaction with the pictures she made there, especially her “abstraction done in the tower”: “She is very happy over it and well she may be,” he wrote. “I, myself, would be pleased to have done it.” Modotti heightened the ambiguity of this already abstract composition by printing it with the platinum process, which registers subtle gradations of tone.",7517.0,"Artist

"Bonaventure Waystop Housing, Chicago, Ilinois, Floor Plan, 1992, Bertrand Goldberg","Several projects in Goldberg’s later career focused on addressing special needs within the medical field in the United States and abroad. His Bonaventure Waystop Housing was designed to offer short-term convalescent care for patients with AIDS. It was developed in partnership with a professor from Northwestern University’s School of Medicine and a priest from the sponsoring Alexian Brothers religious community. As an extension of a Chicago facility opened in 1989, Goldberg’s design was intended to reduce patient hospital stays while providing a sense of community in a distinctly residential setting. At this early date in the history of the disease, his provision of family areas and childcare in the Bonaventure plan speaks to an approach of normalization and dignity, resisting the then-common public climate of stigmatization and fear.",7528.0,"Artist

"Dragon Pendant, Eastern Zhou dynasty , Warring States period (c.480–221 BC)c. 4th/3rd century B.C.","These matching pendants were designed as serpentine dragons with backturned heads, coiled tails, and small fins that project above and below their undulating trunks. The rhythmic fluency of these creatures belies the unyielding quality of jade—a compact, fine-grained stone that cannot be carved and must be worn away with abrasive paste applied to its surface with saws, grinders, and drills. The craftsman’s remarkable dexterity with this intractable material is displayed in smoothly rounded, heart-shaped units and delicately incised spirals, striations, and cross-hatching that thoroughly enliven both the front and back surfaces. Their substantial size and thickness, technical refinement, and glossy polish point to aristocratic patronage. That these pendants were likely designed to drape down the owner’s shoulders or from a waistband is indicated by holes pierced for suspension through the creatures’ hindquarters. Toward the end of the Bronze Age when these pendants were created, sinuously curved dragons had become prominent motifs in many luxurious materials. Contemporary literature suggests that such dynamic creatures were not merely decorative but also envisioned as supernatural beings. When buried with the deceased, jade pendants like these may have reflected widely held beliefs in the dragon as a vehicle that could transport the human soul on its journey to the netherworld.",7529.0,"Title

"Pah-Puh, 1898, Elbridge Ayer Burbank","In 1897 the Chicago artist Elbridge Ayer Burbank traveled west on behalf of his uncle, the philanthropist Edward E. Ayer, to paint a portrait of the famed Apache chief Geronimo, who was then living in captivity at Fort Sill in the Oklahoma territory. During his subsequent travels throughout the West, Burbank depicted individuals from numerous Native American tribes in ethnographic portraits, nevertheless focusing a sensitive artistic eye on his sitters. Like Hermon Atkins MacNeil before him, Burbank witnessed the Hopi Snake Dance in Arizona and followed the dance’s nine-day progress, ultimately producing more than 19 paintings of the participants. The Art Institute owns eight of these portraits. Each element of paint and dress carries a specific meaning in Burbank’s portraits. In his depictions of the Hopi priests Ko-Pe-Ley and Ho-Mo-Vi, for example, the black paint on the upper parts of their faces represents heavy rain clouds, and the white around their mouths stands for purity and faith. Eagle feathers, used in the ceremony to soothe the snakes, adorn their hair. Thus costumed, the priests would have removed the snakes from a special bag and placed the reptiles crosswise in their mouths. Despite his slightly loose brushwork, Burbank carefully depicted the priests’ ceremonial garb, giving his images anthropological authenticity as well as aesthetic power. He inscribed each portrait with the sitter’s name and tribal affiliation, using ""Moqui,"" an obsolete term for the Hopi people that is now considered offensive.",7546.0,"Artist

"Paldao “Ectoplastic” Desk (No. 4106), c. 1940, Gilbert Rohde","Through his nearly two decades of work for the Herman Miller Furniture Company, Gilbert Rohde helped define American modern design in the first half of the 20th century. In 1940 he created the Paldao Group, an 80-piece suite of furniture influenced by the biomorphic shapes associated with Surrealism. Rohde himself considered the desk from this group to be such a successful example of an undulating, organic, yet wholly modern form that he used the term ectoplastic to describe it. Reduced to a series of masses and planes, its top appears to float just above the pedestal, which gives it a sculptural effect. Here Rohde merged the avant-garde with the old-fashioned, combining precious paldao and acacia woods with long-established decorative elements, and taking advantage of contemporary material technologies by using imitation rather than real leather.",7547.0,"Artist
