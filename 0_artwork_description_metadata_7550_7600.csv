"Century of Progress Exposition Tower of Water and Light, Chicago, Illinois, Final Design, 1930, Ralph Thomas Walker","Beginning in 1929, the planning commission of the Century of Progress Exposition worked on developing a scheme for the fairgrounds, themes for major buildings, and a centerpiece of inspirational proportions. New York architect Ralph Walker, a member of the commission, proposed a Tower of Light and Water, which was a soaring skyscraper-scale sculpture set in a lagoon. Cascading water and the lavish use of artificial light were to add even more drama to the giant structure.
The Depression forced the commission to scale back its plans. A combination of financial doubts (the tower provided minimal rentable space) and technical uncertainties about the complex water feats forced the proposal’s demise. A structure called the Skyride was built in its place as the centerpiece of the Century of Progress. Visitors could ride the aerial gondola between the main fair ground and the Island, or climb one of the 600-ft. towers and have a spectacular view of the city.",7553.0,"Artist

"High Chest of Drawers, 1755/85, John Goddard","Along with Philadelphia and Boston, Newport, Rhode Island, was one of the three leading furniture-making centers in colonial America. Newport benefited from its location on coastal trade routes between England and the West Indies, and its merchants were among the wealthiest and most influential figures in the colonies. The finest Newport furniture came from the Goddard and Townsend shops, whose most notable pieces were completed before the Revolution. This high chest is attributed to John Goddard. Goddard’s marriage to the daughter of Job Townsend joined the two families, beginning a virtual furniture-making dynasty that remained active into the following century.",7566.0,"Artist

One tosses its bluish entrails about like a dress train, while others rattle dry bones. Fingerprints appear on the right side of this evidently well-thumbed page. A user also bracketed the text below that begins, “Nothing is better than death,” underscoring the importance of the memento mori (Remember you must die) message offered by the work.

"Truth has died, plate 79 from The Disasters of War, 1815/20, published 1863, Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes","Though not the last plate of the series, this print finalizes its central themes in a profound manner, claiming that truth itself is dead. Here, personified by a shining corpse about to be buried, truth connotes constitutional liberty. Justice is featured at the right, clasping her scales in her left hand. She covers her face, perhaps weeping, as if she cannot bear the scene before her. By ending the series on this note of despair, Francisco de Goya brought an answer to the question of what must come to pass (plate one)—the final blow of war is that truth is dead and justice despondent.",7578.0,"Artist

"Saint George, 1506, Benedetto Montagna","Here Saint George is depicted after killing a dragon, the action for which he is best known; the princess he has rescued from the dragon kneels to the left, while a young squire stands next to his master’s horse. The figures occupy an open-air architectural space with a gateway and pinnacled walls. This is the second state of Benedetto Montagna’s engraving; the saint is shown in three-quarter profile, and the princess looks directly at the saint. Benedetto applied diagonal hatching and loose lines, suggesting an interest in the work of Girolamo Mocetto, while the use of heavy highlighting reflects an awareness of Albrecht Dürer’s technique.",7590.0,"Artist

"Low Piece (Bench), 1985/86, Scott Burton","Best known for meticulously crafted pieces made of stone, metal, and concrete, Scott Burton consistently demonstrated a profound awareness of aesthetics and utility. Creating works that blur the boundaries between sculpture and furniture, he began his early studio pieces from the 1970s as found objects, usually mass-produced furniture. In the 1980s, he moved squarely into the realm of original design, producing rigorously reductive, geometric, and abstract pieces such as Low Piece (Bench). An example of Burton’s mature style, this piece conveys his passion for combining fine art and practical design and, in the process, opening up the scope of inquiry for both disciplines. All of Burton’s late works, including studio objects presented in traditional gallery spaces or site-specific projects for public areas, carry the potential for practical public use. Visitors are invited to use this sculpture as a bench.",7598.0,"Artist

"Detail Study #1 for “Package Deal”, 1956, Stuart Davis","Although he studied with the quintessential early 20th-century American painter Robert Henri, Stuart Davis was profoundly influenced by European abstract art, especially the flattened planes of Cubist art that he saw at the 1913 Armory Show in New York. Later Davis also used the solid forms of signage and advertising to evoke the tempo of jazz and urban street life, as in this drawing. Made as a commission for Fortune magazine in 1956, Package Deal is a series of works in which Davis reinterpreted the traditional theme of still life.",7599.0,"Artist
