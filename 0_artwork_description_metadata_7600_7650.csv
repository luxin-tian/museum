"Box Sofa, c. 1820, Duncan Phyfe","Unlike its predecessors in the Federal period, this box sofa exhibits a pronounced rectilinear form that draws the eye to its luxurious materials. Its bold shape reflects the influence of contemporary French Restoration–style furniture, which was both imported to the United States and made domestically by immigrant cabinetmakers such as Charles-Honoré Lannuier and Duncan Phyfe.",7600.0,"Artist

"Detail Study #1 for “Package Deal”, 1956, Stuart Davis","Although he studied with the quintessential early 20th-century American painter Robert Henri, Stuart Davis was profoundly influenced by European abstract art, especially the flattened planes of Cubist art that he saw at the 1913 Armory Show in New York. Later Davis also used the solid forms of signage and advertising to evoke the tempo of jazz and urban street life, as in this drawing. Made as a commission for Fortune magazine in 1956, Package Deal is a series of works in which Davis reinterpreted the traditional theme of still life.",7601.0,"Artist

"Relief Plaque, Early 1st century AD, Ancient Roman","During the early Roman Empire, terra-cotta relief plaques were a popular form of interior decoration for houses, public baths, and tombs. The mold-made reliefs, which could be rapidly reproduced to create a decorative frieze, reflect an interest in older Greek styles. Here female temple attendants, whose costumes and hairstyles recall fashions worn at least 200 years earlier by the Greek occupants of southern Italy and Sicily, kneel before a tall incense burner, upon which they place an offering. The scene is bordered by an egg-and-dart pattern above and a lotus pattern below. The presence of four nailholes indicates that these panels
were likely affixed to a wall.",7603.0,"Culture

"Pilgrim Flask, Tang dynasty (618–907 A.D.), first half of 8th century","Trans-Asiatic trade expanded the Chinese repertoire of simple, wheel-thrown clay shapes to include composite forms pressed in molds. This pilgrim flask—a vessel shape that may imitate forms originally made in glass, leather, or metalwork —depicts a young boy adorned with a billowing scarf, who dances with a lion. Although similar images can be traced back to Hellenistic Greece (c. 300-200 B.C.), the extent of such Classical influence on the much later art of Tang dynasty China has yet to be determined.",7605.0,"Title

Here Israhel van Meckenem depicted Judith stuffing Holofernes’s head into her maidservant’s pouch while a battle rages in the background.

"New York City, 1988, printed 2002, Joel Meyerowitz","Joel Meyerowitz is known for producing richly saturated images of daily American life and landscapes. Like Claude Monet, who created numerous studies of seasonal light falling on haystacks, Meyerowitz produced these images of the New York City skyline from his studio in varying amounts of light and at different times of day. With our knowledge of just how radically this skyline would change after the tragic events of September 11, 2001, however, the photographs become haunting records of a city that was. The twin towers of the World Trade Center—gently bathed in morning light, backlit, illuminated against the night sky—appear indestructible. After the attacks, Meyerowitz was the only photographer who was allowed unrestricted access to the nine-month cleanup at Ground Zero, where he made over 5,000 large-format images of the workers and the scene. He published this expansive record in Aftermath: World Trade Center Archive.",7645.0,"Artist

"Ko-Pe-Ley, 1898, Elbridge Ayer Burbank","In 1897 the Chicago artist Elbridge Ayer Burbank traveled west on behalf of his uncle, the philanthropist Edward E. Ayer, to paint a portrait of the famed Apache chief Geronimo, who was then living in captivity at Fort Sill in the Oklahoma territory. During his subsequent travels throughout the West, Burbank depicted individuals from numerous Native American tribes in ethnographic portraits, nevertheless focusing a sensitive artistic eye on his sitters. Like Hermon Atkins MacNeil before him, Burbank witnessed the Hopi Snake Dance in Arizona and followed the dance’s nine-day progress, ultimately producing more than 19 paintings of the participants. The Art Institute owns eight of these portraits. Each element of paint and dress carries a specific meaning in Burbank’s portraits. In his depictions of the Hopi priests Ko-Pe-Ley and Ho-Mo-Vi, for example, the black paint on the upper parts of their faces represents heavy rain clouds, and the white around their mouths stands for purity and faith. Eagle feathers, used in the ceremony to soothe the snakes, adorn their hair. Thus costumed, the priests would have removed the snakes from a special bag and placed the reptiles crosswise in their mouths. Despite his slightly loose brushwork, Burbank carefully depicted the priests’ ceremonial garb, giving his images anthropological authenticity as well as aesthetic power. He inscribed each portrait with the sitter’s name and tribal affiliation, using ""Moqui,"" an obsolete term for the Hopi people that is now considered offensive.",7646.0,"Artist
