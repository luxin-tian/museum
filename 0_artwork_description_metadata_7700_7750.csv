"Greeting card for 1916: “The corn was frosted”, 1916, Gustave Baumann","During his lifetime Baumann created a wide variety of printed ephemera, including Christmas cards, calendars, marriage announcements, booklets, and stationery. Here, one of Baumann’s foremost utilitarian objects is the 1917 calendar he produced on commission for the Packard Motor Car Company. Baumann’s work demonstrates his ability to create art objects from everyday household items, melding art with design and aesthetics with functionality.",7702.0,"Artist

"Container, Early/mid–20th century, Nuna","The complex form of this tall and narrow storage vessel was constructed in several phases, starting with the base, which was textured with a roulette (a toothed disk), and followed by the foot. The upper half, culminating in the ribbed neck, was then built using a coiling technique. The lid was likely formed separately. The imagery on its surface includes tall staffs that may represent old iron currency; a snake; and a bush-buffalo head signifying prosperity, protection, and fertility.",7704.0,"Culture

"In a Railway Carriage (After a Night’s Journey), 1851, Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel","This is a remarkable example of an early work from a pioneering proponent of Realism. Menzel revealed the unglamorous aspect of bourgeois train travel in many compelling details: a man asleep in a contorted position, a wistful woman gazing out at early morning light, the detritus of their journey around them. Menzel began to use opaque watercolor (gouache) in 1850, combining it with pastel (and oil) as seen here.",7705.0,"Artist

"Head (I), 1958, Leon Golub","A leading cultural and civil rights activist in the United States from the early 1960s until his death in 2004, Leon Golub consistently created works that addressed humanitarian issues. Head (I) suggests the tragic heroes of ancient Greece or Rome––cultures that produced idealized images of clarity, beauty, and strength. This monumental modern counterpart, however, is scarred, vulnerable, and massively imperfect.",7708.0,"Artist

"Bowl Depicting a Ritual Figure and Flaming Torches, A.D. 300/600, Teotihuacan","Teotihuacan ceramic vessels were often fired and coated with a fine plaster that was then painted with figures and symbolic elements. This technique was derived from methods employed by mural painters, who covered masonry walls with fine plaster to serve as the ground for large-scale frescoes. The flaming torch may well allude to the ceremony of New Fire, kindled at New Year’s festivals and every 52 years at the inauguration of a new “century” in the native calendar system.",7710.0,"Culture

"Rectangular Cauldron, Shang dynasty ( about 1600–1046 BC ), 12th/11th century","Unlike most bronze vessels whose shapes were derived from prehistoric ceramic forms, this type of rectangular container was invented by Shang bronze artisans. Each side features a pair of profile birds with long, trailing tailfeathers. The black material in sunken areas of this design contains carbon. This filler is common to many Shang bronzes and seems to have been deliberately applied after casting in order to emphasize the surface decoration.",7720.0,"Title

"The Calumny of Apelles, 1500/1506, Girolamo Mocetto","Although he probably never met Andrea Mantegna, the Venetian painter-engraver Girolamo Mocetto nevertheless based this print on a drawing (now in the British Museum, London) by the older artist. Later, Rembrandt also copied the same drawing, and may have owned it for a time. Mocetto altered the composition by placing the scene, an allegory of calumny (or false accusation), in the Campo de Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, with Andrea del Verrocchio’s famous equestrian monument to Bartolomeo Colleoni in the background. This print is a unique early state before final shading was added to the basilica dome.",7721.0,"Artist

"Dish with Peaches and Bats, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Yongzheng reign mark and period (1723–1735)","Chinese porcelains known in the West by the French term famille rose (pink family) are distinguished by pastel shades of overglaze enamel, primarily pink derived from colloidal gold—tiny fragments of crushed gold dissolved in translucent enamel. Previously unknown in China, such delicately colored mineral pigments were partly inspired by the art of painted enamel on copper that was introduced to the Chinese court by northern European Jesuit missionaries in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Masterfully created and applied by potters and painters at the imperial workshops, these subtle tones were termed ""powdered colors”, “soft colors,” and “foreign colors.” by their court patrons.",7728.0,"Title

"Stag Hunt in Fan Shape, 1630/60, Stefano della Bella","Stefano della Bella made several printed fans that were meant to be cut out, mounted, and used, an application inspired by a fan Jacques Callot made in 1619 for the Medici family. A unique example in a canonical folding fan shape depicts a stag hunt. This undated proof is trimmed just outside the platemark, showing that the plate was cut to follow the shape of the accessory it depicted. The lively intertwining of the floral wreaths along the borders and around the main action emphasizes the sense of three-dimensionality that would result when the print was fully constructed.",7731.0,"Artist

"Stem Cup, Tang dynasty (A.D. 618–907), 9th century","The form of this wine cup was inspired by goblets made in the Sasanian and Sogdian empires, but originally derived from Hellenistic styles of the Mediterranean world. Its low, spreading foot gently flares into faceted petals suggesting a lotus flower. Since the introduction of Buddhism to China, the lotus—which emerges unstained from muddy water and therefore carries associations of purity and non-attachment to worldly concerns—had become a pervasive motif in secular as well as religious art. Two layers of petals, beaten in repousse, enclose birds, floral sprays, and clusters of grapes—all delicately chased and gilded against a ringmatted ground. This mixture of native and imported decorative motifs, which followed the seventh-century introduction of grapevines and grape wine from Iranian and Turkic lands, is executed with a linear fluency that is distinctively Chinese.",7732.0,"Title
