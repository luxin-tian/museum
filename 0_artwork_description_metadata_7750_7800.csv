"Leaving the Bath, 1879–80, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","Images of women washing themselves are ubiquitous in the history of Western art. The female nude in general has long been considered one of the most important subjects of artistic expression, most importantly in the form of history painting, traditionally represented in classical or biblical subjects. However, in the late 19th century progressive artists spurned traditional history painting in favor of contemporary subject matter—art of the moment that represented real life. The artists featured in this gallery made the theme of the bathing woman thoroughly modern. During this period, public health officials encouraged regular bathing not only for cosmetic reasons, but also as a means to combat diseases such as cholera. As a result, more and more people washed indoors regularly. The images in this gallery by Edgar Degas, Félix Vallotton, Pierre Bonnard, and Suzanne Valadon, for example, show modern accouterments of indoor plumbing—large porcelain tubs and taps for running water. Though these prints and drawings allude to contemporary industrial developments and evolving societal expectations, they remain principally devoid of narrative. They depict anonymous women across a range of social classes, including some models who were probably prostitutes, in the intimate act of washing. These artists used the subject of the bathing woman as an evocative means to an end—especially Degas, who returned to the theme of the bather literally hundreds of times between the late 1870s and his death in 1917. Degas utilized bathers to explore the possibilities of the human form—employing multiple angles and viewpoints, depicting its shape and various movements, and reflecting the many colors and textures of the environment.",7755.0,"Artist

"One of a Pair of Shrine Figures, Late 19th/early 20th century, Ewe","The Ewe, Aja, Fon, and other culturally related peoples share a religious practice known as Vodun, a word that is also used to describe, in the scholar Suzanne Blier’s words, the “mysterious forces or powers that govern the world and the lives of those who reside within it.” Among the best-known artworks associated with Vodun are sophisticated sculptures in metal made for royal patrons, and wooden sculptures, often unsettling in appearance that are covered, wrapped, and bound with empowering materials. Pottery, however, also plays an important role in the visual expression of Vodun. Distinctive terracotta vessels and figures are associated with individual deities and prominently displayed in temples and on shrines.",7766.0,"Culture

"One of a Pair of Shrine Figures, Late 19th/early 20th century, Ewe","Open at the bottom and hollow within, this impressive figure [and its companion, 2005.238.2] is an essentially upside-down pot and was doubtlessly made by a potter. It is heavily stained to the waist with the dripping lines of sacrificial offerings and was probably even partially buried in the ground below that point, as can be seen in a photograph from Southern Ghana of a similar figure in situ. Such figures have been described as protective and as representations of ancestors, and they may signify one of the many Vodun that come into being when an important person dies. Why this figure, together with its mate [2005.238.2], represent two males is unknown, but the pieces’ equivalent size, appearance, and indications of use suggest that they were almost certainly made and displayed together. Each is portrayed with an erect penis, a frequent symbol of the deity Legba that may refer more generally to danger, deception, and trickery.",7766.0,"Culture

"10-Unit System Chair, 2009, Shigeru Ban","Japanese architect Shigeru Ban has become recognized for the development of socially conscious projects through his innovative use of materials and unconventional approach to architecture and design. He is perhaps best known for developing modular papertube constructions used to swiftly and inexpensively erect temporary buildings that provide shelter and services to people who have been displaced by natural disasters. Ban has also applied his practice of modular design with recyclable materials to the design of consumer objects, as seen here in the 10-Unit System, manufactured by Artek. Similar to the paper tube constructions, Ban developed a system of parts—identical in form—that can be arranged in multiple configurations. In this piece a range of objects, including a chair, a table, and a bench, can be created through the simple L-shaped component made from a wood plastic composite. Through the use of hybrid construction methods and his intimate knowledge of materials, Ban created this furniture that is easy to assemble and disassemble, providing maximum flexibility for the user.",7775.0,"Artist

Augustus Saint-Gaudens produced this bronze relief in exchange for a portrait of his wife and son by Sargent. Clothed in contemporary dress and playing a guitar, Violet projects charm, elegance, and sophistication—similar to a sitter in a Sargent portrait in oil. Musical instruments were often included in late 19th-century depictions of young upper-class women as a way of suggesting the leisure and refinement these women were expected to embody. The varying degrees of relief and the harmonious lines of this work attest to Saint-Gaudens’s technical prowess and his sensitivity to the medium of bronze.",7778.0,"Artist

"Houses of Parliament, London, 1900/01, Claude Monet","During his London campaigns, Claude Monet painted the Houses of Parliament in the late afternoon and at sunset from a terrace at Saint Thomas’s Hospital. This viewpoint was close to that of the English artist J. M. W. Turner in his visionary paintings of the fire that had destroyed much of the old Parliament complex in 1834.

"Blast Furnace and Dust Catcher, Ford Plant, 1927, Charles Sheeler","Charles Sheeler was both a painter and a photographer of architecture and industrial forms in the highly detailed Precisionist style. In 1927, Sheeler was commissioned to photograph Ford Motor Company’s mammoth manufacturing facility, the River Rouge Factory, in Dearborn, Michigan, which Sheeler called “incomparably the most thrilling [subject] I have had to work with.” The project was part of an advertising campaign designed to show the factory—and thus its parent company—as “one huge, perfectly timed, smoothly operating machine.” Sheeler chose not to photograph Ford automobiles or even assembly lines, but instead focused on the geometric patterns and abstract designs of the factory itself. Sheeler’s images depict machinery as coherent, natural forms and reveal his view, held by many modernist artists, that the very efficiency of machinery in function and design was itself a thing of beauty.",7781.0,"Artist

"The Dancing Trees, 1922, Alfred Stieglitz","A photographer who vigorously promoted the work of modern artists in all media, Alfred Stieglitz spearheaded turn–of–the–century debates on the role of photography as a fine art. Initially, this inquiry led him to promote Pictorialism, a style imitative of painting. By the 1910s, however, he had renounced this painterly mode in favor of “straight photography,” exploring qualities that—so he argued—photography alone possessed. At his summer house on Lake George, in upstate New York, Stieglitz isolated the components of landscape, photographing clouds without any indication of a horizon line and sections of trees separated from the surrounding woods. In The Dancing Trees, the composition produced by the layered and interlaced trunks and branches highlights Stieglitz’s primary aim at this time: “to think more about the relationships in the pictures than subject–matter for its own sake.",7784.0,"Artist

"Teardrop I, 1996, Magdalene Odundo","Kenyan-born ceramic artist Magdalene Odundo is one of the foremost contemporary artists from Africa working today. Born in Kenya in 1950 and currently living in the United Kingdom, Odundo creates works that rely on a unique combination of formal and surface treatments and are almost ethereal in their effect. This piece was one of four vessels that Odundo completed in late 1996. Its highly polished, bright red-orange surface and elegant form were achieved through an exacting and time-consuming process of hand building, followed by intensive burnishing with small polished stones, the application of a terra sigillata slip, and multiple firings. Odundo has explained that in her work she attempts to create pieces with perfect harmony, symmetry, and balance. Her sources of inspiration include ceramics from Africa, the American Southwest, Ancient Greece and Rome, and modern Europe.
Although Odundo’s pots as a whole are distinctive, she does not repeat her work; each vessel is different, although sometimes only subtly. This work is roughly teardrop in shape, with a pointed bottom and wide, flaring hips that attenuate into a graceful, fluted neck with a wide rim. The disparity in size from the base to the mouth creates a tension, producing a visual effect that causes the piece to appear as if suspended in a moment, much like a snapshot or a dancer’s pose (See also 2001.409).

"The Five Virtues, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), 1895, Ren Yi","Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called Shanghai School. Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This work represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.",7795.0,"Artist

Above, a pair of long-tailed phoenixes roosting in the branches of a Wutong tree represents the preeminent relationship: a ruler and his subjects. Emerging from behind are two cranes, who, more commonly associated with longevity, represent filial piety. Perched above the cranes, a pair of orioles signifies the relationship between older and younger siblings. Marital loyalty is embodied in the pair of ducks swimming in the water below, and friendship is captured in the jovial interaction of two wagtails.
