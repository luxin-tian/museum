"Nude Blowing Spit Bubble, 1980, Peter Hujar","Peter Hujar was a central figure in New York City’s East Village art scene during the 1970s and 1980s. He became best known for portraits of drag queens and cultural personalities like filmmaker John Waters and artist David Wojnarowicz. Like many of his portraits, this photograph has a restrained erotic charge. Hujar cultivated a personal connection with his sitters, often based on sexual attraction, that emphasized their vulnerability. He isolated his subject in a neutral space, to encourage uninhibited contemplation and easy nakedness, and maintained constant conversation, to help sitters relax and perform as themselves for the camera. As fellow artist Nan Goldin recalled, “He captured people at their most quiet and introspective, externalizing their internal selves, achieving that rare balance of exposing the beauty of the flesh while making visible the spirit.”",7811.0,"Artist

"Rocks at Port-Goulphar, Belle-Île, 1886, Claude Monet","Belle-Ile, a small island off the southern shore of Brittany, was known for its dramatic cliffs, rock formations, and grottoes. As he often did, Claude Monet misjudged the time he would need to explore and capture the beauty of the place, which he variously called “lugubrious,” “terrifying,” and “very beautiful.” He came for two weeks and stayed for more than two months. This canvas is one of a group depicting the frieze of rock formations known as Port-Goulphar.",7812.0,"Artist

"Hercules Killing the Mares of Diomedes, 1800/05, Henry Fuseli","In classical Greek mythology, Hercules is assigned twelve superhuman labors to complete. The eighth of these is to capture the man-eating horses of Diomedes, king of Thrace. In most accounts, Hercules subdues and steals the mares, killing Diomedes and feeding him to his own horses. Fuseli has chosen the less familiar narrative, in which Hercules kills the mares as well. The defeated Diomedes can be seen collapsing on the left. The hero’s young companion, Abderus, killed by the mares, lies on the right.
Hercules’s hypermuscularity is rendered with bold and rapid strokes of the pen assisted by sparely applied, volume-defining gray wash.",7822.0,"Artist

"Model Artillery with Field Carriage, 1580/1600, Germain Pilon","A mask, the open mouth of which acts as a vent for the cannon, is chiseled in relief at the breech end of the barrel. Inscribed above the mask is the name Dodeman, which could be the name of either the artist or the owner of the cannon. Skillfully chased and sculpted on a stippled ground are relief figures—a warrior in classical armor holding a shield and wielding a sword, a figure of Fame standing on a helmet and breastplate under a canopy, and a figure of Victory. A rare feature of this finely cast and chased bronze cannon is the field carriage with old nails that appears to be original.",7827.0,"Artist

"Cyrus Defeats Spargapises, from The Story of Cyrus, c. 1670, Michiel Coxcie, I","This tapestry is from a late-17th-century series derived from the earlier compositions of the Renaissance painter and designer Michiel Coxie. The Latin inscription in a cartouche in the upper border identified the subject as Cyrus the Great defeating the Scythians. This refers to an episode toward the end of Cyrus’s extraordinary career when he attacked the land ruled by Queen Tomyris near the Caspian Sea. As recounted by Greek historians such as Herodotus, the Persian ruler lured the queen’s son Spargapises into a trap, defeating him and taking him captive. However, Tomyris was so angered by her son’s humiliation and subsequent suicide that she defeated Cyrus in battle and killed him.",7837.0,"Artist

"Woman Bathing, c. 1942, Pierre Bonnard","Images of women washing themselves are ubiquitous in the history of Western art. The female nude in general has long been considered one of the most important subjects of artistic expression, most importantly in the form of history painting, traditionally represented in classical or biblical subjects. However, in the late 19th century progressive artists spurned traditional history painting in favor of contemporary subject matter—art of the moment that represented real life. The artists featured in this gallery made the theme of the bathing woman thoroughly modern. During this period, public health officials encouraged regular bathing not only for cosmetic reasons, but also as a means to combat diseases such as cholera. As a result, more and more people washed indoors regularly. The images in this gallery by Edgar Degas, Félix Vallotton, Pierre Bonnard, and Suzanne Valadon, for example, show modern accouterments of indoor plumbing—large porcelain tubs and taps for running water. Though these prints and drawings allude to contemporary industrial developments and evolving societal expectations, they remain principally devoid of narrative. They depict anonymous women across a range of social classes, including some models who were probably prostitutes, in the intimate act of washing. These artists used the subject of the bathing woman as an evocative means to an end—especially Degas, who returned to the theme of the bather literally hundreds of times between the late 1870s and his death in 1917. Degas utilized bathers to explore the possibilities of the human form—employing multiple angles and viewpoints, depicting its shape and various movements, and reflecting the many colors and textures of the environment.",7845.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1987, Louise Lawler","Since the early 1980s, Louise Lawler has photographed works of art installed in auction houses, corporate headquarters, galleries, museums, and private homes in order to demonstrate how an object’s display and contextualization can shape its meaning. The resulting images transcend pure documentation. Her appropriation of works in situ addresses the broader social and economic issues that structure modes of presentation. These early photographs, often displayed as a triptych, deal with the theme of monogramming and, by extension, personal vanity. Depicting a couch with a Lacoste emblem, Alligator draws our attention to the Donald Judd sculpture above it and the reflection of the artist in its surface. Untitled shows a Jasper Johns painting, visible through the clear glass of a vitrine that exhibits Robert Rauschenberg’s oddly titled Monogram (1955–59; Moderna Museet, Stockholm). Lastly, Monogram depicts Johns’s White Flag (1955; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) hanging over a bed with a duvet lavishly embroidered with the owner’s initials. This sequence shows that Lawler is constantly making connections between various categories of signs, curatorial concerns of private collectors and museums, and the questions raised by redisplaying these pieces as the subject matter of “original” works of art.",7848.0,"Artist
