"Untitled, 1987, Louise Lawler","Since the early 1980s, Louise Lawler has photographed works of art installed in auction houses, corporate headquarters, galleries, museums, and private homes in order to demonstrate how an object’s display and contextualization can shape its meaning. The resulting images transcend pure documentation. Her appropriation of works in situ addresses the broader social and economic issues that structure modes of presentation. These early photographs, often displayed as a triptych, deal with the theme of monogramming and, by extension, personal vanity. Depicting a couch with a Lacoste emblem, Alligator draws our attention to the Donald Judd sculpture above it and the reflection of the artist in its surface. Untitled shows a Jasper Johns painting, visible through the clear glass of a vitrine that exhibits Robert Rauschenberg’s oddly titled Monogram (1955–59; Moderna Museet, Stockholm). Lastly, Monogram depicts Johns’s White Flag (1955; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) hanging over a bed with a duvet lavishly embroidered with the owner’s initials. This sequence shows that Lawler is constantly making connections between various categories of signs, curatorial concerns of private collectors and museums, and the questions raised by redisplaying these pieces as the subject matter of “original” works of art.",7850.0,"Artist

"Headdress (Jagún Jagún), Mid–/late 19th century, Yoruba","This imposing sculptural headdress would have been worn in masquerades honoring Ogun, the Yoruba god of iron, warfare, and technology. It was also part of a shrine where offerings of yams were applied to its surface. Ogun is depicted as a warrior on horseback who carries a shield with four human heads, possibly slain enemies. The smaller figure playing a flute represents Eshu, the divine messenger and god of human destiny.",7851.0,"Culture

"Charing Cross Bridge, London, 1901, Claude Monet","Beginning in September 1899, Claude Monet made almost one hundred paintings of the river Thames in London. These works show only three different views—Charing Cross Bridge and Waterloo Bridge, both painted from the Savoy Hotel; and the Houses of Parliament, painted from Saint Thomas’s Hospital. In the smoggy, industrial city, Monet challenged himself to capture effects of light seen through a dense atmospheric screen. Beyond the rectilinear skeleton of Charing Cross Bridge—reminiscent of bridges in Japanese prints, which the artist collected—rises the ghostlike silhouette of the Houses of Parliament.",7853.0,"Artist

"The Flagellation, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",7862.0,"Artist

"Female Figure, Early 20th century, Nyamwezi","The commanding size of this elongated figure differentiates it from other Nyamwezi figures in museum collections. It was made in seven pieces that can be assembled easily into an asymmetrical and off-balanced pose. Some hallmarks of Nyamwezi art are expressed in this sculpture, including unsettling references to crippling infirmity in the form of a goiter (an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid near the throat), awkwardly bent legs, knobby joints, and blocky feet.",7865.0,"Culture

"Plaque with the Crucifixion, 1200/10, Limoges Pottery and Porcelain Factories","This plaque was probably once part of a casket or tabernacle. It was produced by the specialized workshops for enamel objects in Limoges, France. Here Christ on the cross is flanked by the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist. The Christ’s central importance is signaled by his larger size and by the fact that his is the only figure fully modeled in the round rather than engraved into the copper support. The imagery on tabernacles that survive intact (notably in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) suggests that plaque would have originally been surmounted by another depicting the Ascension of Christ into heaven.",7869.0,"Artist

"Beach of Silenus, 1964, Bob Thompson","Robert Thompson appropriated compositions from Old European Masters, rearranging and integrating them with his own symbolic language and figural style. In his reconfiguration of established themes, he eliminated narrative content and instead created abstract patterns that loosely convey a feeling or an idea. The thick acrylic paint produces a dynamic, textured surface; flat, overlapping fields of color create linear and chromatic rhythms and planes advance and recede in space. Despite deriving inspiration from canonical works of art, Thompson’s improvisatoinsal working method demonstrates affinities with the post-bebop jazz of the 1960s.",7877.0,"Artist

"The Vintage of the Grapes of the Vine, from the Blockbook Apocalypse, 1465–70","Blockbooks were hand-printed from wooden blocks with hand-carved text. This woodcut is the lower half of a page representing visions from the Book of Revelations. The upper half showed a grain harvest; this half demonstrates the production of wine. Both were highly symbolic substances for the sacrament of the Eucharist. This stencil-colored sheet is almost identical to other surviving impressions. Although part of a book, only one side was printed, due to high embossing created by the process. In this impression, an owner has used the verso as scrap paper, taking copious notes on Latin vocabulary starting with the letter c.",7890.0,"Title

"Village Fete (Saint George’s Fair), from a Teniers series, c. 1710, David Teniers","This tapestry shows a group of peasants and townspeople dancing and partaking in a feast in front of houses and other buildings. A flag fluttering from the attic window of a tavern depicts Saint George, the patron saint of agricultural workers, an indication that the festivities are taking place on his saint’s day, April 23. Such portrayals of country life were extremely popular in 18th-century Europe. They are called Teniers, after the 17th-century Flemish artist David II Teniers, who was known as a painter of peasants and village feasts, and whose sympathetic depiction of rural life distinguished his work from traditional approaches to the genre. Archival evidence indicates that Teniers himself designed a tapestry set showing such scenes, and that this piece, Village Fete, forms part of this influential initial series. At least five other episodes comprise the set, including Milking Scene, Fish Quay, Gypsy Fortune-Teller, Hunters Resting, and Fruit and Vegetable Market.",7891.0,"Artist

"Melpomene, plate seventeen from Apollo and the Muses, c. 1465, Master of the E-Series Tarocchi","The deck of fifty so-called Tarocchi are not tarots in the modern, fortune-telling sense, nor were they intended as playing cards. No cut-out impressions mounted for play are known, and they lack the suits and numbers of a regular deck. Instead, these delicately engraved didactic allegories are grouped in five numbered ranks describing the workings of the spheres of man, the muses, the liberal arts, the cosmos, and the heavens in order of increasing significance, and offer a didactic sequence to educate courtly youths or possibly university students, who could have used them as flashcards or a pamphlet.",7893.0,"Artist

"The Skeletons, 1750, Giovanni Battista Piranesi","This print is one of four grotesques (decorative fantasies) included in Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s popular series of architectural views of Rome and its surroundings. This kind of composition was inspired by Roman wall decorations discovered during the Renaissance and was meant to incorporate dissimilar elements in a whimsical and ornamental manner. This particular etching includes, among other things, a back view of the often-copied Farnese Hercules, a large zodiac wheel partly visible at the upper right, and various fragmentary skeletons adorned with tufts of wavy hair.",7899.0,"Artist
