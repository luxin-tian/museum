"The Skeletons, 1750, Giovanni Battista Piranesi","This print is one of four grotesques (decorative fantasies) included in Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s popular series of architectural views of Rome and its surroundings. This kind of composition was inspired by Roman wall decorations discovered during the Renaissance and was meant to incorporate dissimilar elements in a whimsical and ornamental manner. This particular etching includes, among other things, a back view of the often-copied Farnese Hercules, a large zodiac wheel partly visible at the upper right, and various fragmentary skeletons adorned with tufts of wavy hair.",7901.0,"Artist

"Portrait Head of a Man, Mid–3rd century AD, Ancient Roman","This head, which depicts a man crowned with a wreath, might be a portrait of an emperor. His facial features, including almond-shaped eyes, tight-lipped mouth, faint mustache, and neck whiskers, as well as his triangular head, which tapers toward the chin, suggest his possible identification as Gallienus (r. A.D. 253–68). This type of wreath, which is composed of grape vines and ivy, was worn by Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and theater. Emperors frequently associated themselves with gods by adopting their attributes, or symbols, as numerous emperors portrayed themselves in the guise of Jupiter (the Greek Zeus), the supreme god of the pantheon.",7903.0,"Culture

In Han mythology, such beings are described as immortals (xian). Having achieved eternal life, these immortals were endowed with the power to fly and roamed freely about the universe. The depiction of these remarkable beings in tombs reflects a widespread belief that the soul of the deceased could leave its earth-bound existence, ascend to heaven, and become an immortal. The ascent of the soul to the realm of the immortals is a major theme in Han art.",7917.0,"Title

"“Oceana” Box, c. 1935, Russel Wright","Like Russel Wright’s American Modern line of ceramics, this wooden box was organically inspired and reasonably priced in order to appeal to a wide audience. Wright successfully adapted a sculptural, handcrafted quality to industrial production techniques. Probably designed to hold candy, the box was made for the Oceana line of free-form wooden serving pieces that imitated marine motifs such as the shell. Part of a larger group of home furnishings entitled American Way, the Oceana line was considered appropriate for use in summer homes.",7930.0,"Artist

"Chicago Civic Center: Perspective View of Plaza, 1963, Chicago Civic Center Architects","The Chicago Civic Center was the first of several important new public buildings constructed in Chicago from the late 1950s to the 1980s as part of Mayor Richard J. Daley’s consolidation of spaces for municipal government. The building was designed by a consortium of architectural firms led by designer Jacques Brownson of C.F. Murphy Associates. Because the building was intended to hold over 100 courtrooms in addition to office space, an unprecedented structural system was designed for the building that allowed for exceptionally wide spans between perimeter columns and 18-foot, floor-to-floor heights. Perhaps the most important aspect of this new building, however, was its plaza, described by Brownson as a modern agora. In this early presentation drawing, the plaza is shown as an open space framed by flagpoles and a rather unassuming sculpture by Henry Moore. The dramatic figure of Pablo Picasso’s monumental sculpture joined the project slightly later, after William Hartmann of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill spent many months courting the Spanish artist. Since its unveiling in 1967, the Richard J. Daley Center Sculpture, often referred to simply as the Chicago Picasso, has become a symbol of the city and one of the most popular works of public art in the world.",7933.0,"Artist

"Blue Sea (recto); Sheet of Sketches (verso), 1923, John Marin","In this watercolor from the summer of 1923, Marin looked down over steep ledges studded with rock pine toward the harbor and islands below. He painted with overlapping transparent washes, employing little to no reworking, rewetting, or blotting. The artist used clear water, floating it into adjacent washes along the perimeter to achieve a hazy frame. Strikingly, he superimposed a structure of emphatic horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines painted with a wide brush and blue watercolor. The effect is fencelike, suggesting that Marin might have been painting on a railed porch or the top level of a dock leading down to the water.",7934.0,"Artist

"Mass Tone: Manganese Blue, 1974, Marcia Hafif","Since the early 1970s, Marcia Hafif has systematically examined the historical and technical fundamentals of painting. Her body of work is rigorous and investigative, with a resolute concentration on color manifested by exquisitely complex monochrome paintings. Hafif often employs paint mixtures she has made herself, grinding a pigment with a muller and combining it with linseed oil. Mass Tone: Manganese Blue, titled after the specific pigment used, is from the first series of paintings for which Hafif created her own paints in this way. Unlike commercial paint from the tube, which contains various additives and binders, her handmade paints can behave unpredictably. As Hafif has stated, this patient technique was chosen because it “let a color … express itself, reveal its multiple nuances.” Her process invites us to perceive each particular paint mixture as matter rather than simply as color.",7942.0,"Artist

"Cong, Neolithic period (ca.8000–2000 BC), Liangzhu Culture, ca. 3000–2000 B.C.","Intriguing forms and precisely executed surface designs characterize jade prisms. The inner cylinders were smoothly bored with a tubular drill, probably a shaft of bamboo. The tapered exterior surfaces are subdivided into tiers of masklike images composed of circles and bars, immediately suggesting eyes and nose or mouth. The Liangzhu may have attributed some magic, protective qualities to these masks.
Prisms like this have been found only in tombs. They may be among the earliest objects made specifically for mortuary rituals. Jade-rich burials suggest that Chinese beliefs in the stone’s life-preserving properties originated in prehistoric times.",7946.0,"Title
