"The Engraver and the Etcher, 1643, Abraham Bosse","Abraham Bosse wrote the first important treatise on the art of etching in 1645. His highly influential publication urged etchers to aspire to the precision of engravers, rather than cultivating the peculiarities of the etched line, like Rembrandt. To achieve a swelling line akin to an engraving, bosse utilized an instrument called an ‘échoppe’, a beveled etching needle, which he could twist in the ground to create variable widths of etched line, similar to the work of Jacques Callot. In this print, the etcher is working easily on the left, while the engraver is struggling to incise his plate on the right.",7954.0,"Artist

"Sojo Henjo, twelfth poet in the series One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets Explained by the Nurse, c. 1835/36, Katsushika Hokusai","This is a scene based on the poet’s early career as a descendant of the imperial family and as a court minister, before the poet became a priest. The scene is springtime at court, where a young woman of nobility performs a dance (usually held in the fall) related to the success of the rice crop that was planted annually in the spring by the emperor. Later, of course, this poet became known as the first of the six Poetic Immortals, for his modern poems.",7972.0,"Artist

"Nude, 1962, Richard Diebenkorn","Richard Diebenkorn’s first serious effort at printmaking came in the early 1960s, while he was still working in a representational manner. In 1961 and early 1962 Diebenkorn, who lived in Berkeley, California, taught briefly at the University of California, Los Angeles. He did not have a place to paint in Los Angeles, and at the invitation of Wesley Chamberlin, a graduate assistant in etching at the school, and later a printer-fellow at the Tamarind Institute, Diebenkorn began to make simple drypoints and etchings, drawn from life.",7980.0,"Artist

This second revised version of Venusberg was Fantin-Latour’s first attempt at transfer lithography, a printing method in which the artist’s drawing is transferred directly onto a lithographic stone. Here, Tannhaüser is depicted in Venus’s realm of sensual delights.

He is best known for vibrant three-color dye imbibition prints of nature scenes and cultural landmarks, published in books and portfolios in partnership with the Sierra Club. Hugh Edwards featured Porter’s work in a 1963 exhibition that seems to have cemented his impressions of color photography, which was at this point largely reserved for commercial purposes. “At last I can feel certain,” the curator wrote to Porter, “that great photographs can be made in color—something I was skeptical about for so long.” The following year, the museum acquired 21 prints.",7991.0,"Artist

"Chest, c. 1710, Artist unknown","Intended to store valuable linens, plates, and other goods, this probably served as a dower chest that a young woman brings to her new home upon her marriage. The front of the chest features an elaborate tulip, vine, and heart design intended to reinforce the theme of love. The tulip motif appeared frequently on English textiles, ceramics, and furniture, and it was brought to the American colonies through the immigration of English craftsmen. The tulip, which originated in ancient Persia, symbolized perfect love, and Turkish ceramics incorporating tulips were present in England by the early 17th century. Traces of the original green and red paint on the surface reveal that the chest was initially brightly decorated, which would have emphasized the festive patterning of the tulip theme.",7992.0,"Artist
