"Young Tiger Playing with Its Mother, 1831, Eugène Delacroix","Delacroix based this lithograph on a painting he exhibited at the 1831 Paris Salon to great acclaim, with one critic writing, “Never has this singular artist painted a man that resembles a man, the way his tiger resembles a tiger.” Like the nearby engraving after Rubens’s Lion Hunt (2010.48), this canvas became more widely known through the circulation of a printed reproduction. Delacroix produced this lithograph for the nascent arts and literature periodical L’Artiste, specifically in honor of its supportive director, Achille Ricourt.",8012.0,"Artist

"Figural Container, Late 19th/early 20th century, Zigua","Healing in Tanzania often involves visually evocative objects in order to harness spirit forces. Playing upon the idea of the human body as a container, the artist carved a cavity into this figure’s body; its head functions as the stopper. The single point under its legs would have allowed it to stand upright. Such objects are rarely used today and few healers know the closely guarded secrets that were required to make the figures effective.",8021.0,"Culture

"Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Trajan, 114/15, issued by Trajan, Ancient Roman","The Roman Empire, which flourished from 27 B.C. to A.D. 410, was ruled by a variety of emperors, some who inherited the throne and some who seized it. As rulers came and went, it was important to announce the transition of power quickly. Since the Mint regularly struck coins to pay the armies stationed throughout the empire, it was easy to change the portrait, revise names in the inscription, and publish the news.
During the reign of the emperor Trajan, Rome reached the apogee of its power and territory. Wars of expansion extended the empire from Scotland in the north to Egypt and Gibraltar in the south and east to the Euphrates River. This rare coin was minted during his conquest of Parthia and Armenia. Instead of victory, however, the newly pacified territories soon rose in revolt, ending in Rome’s retreat and Trajan’s death.",8029.0,"Culture

"Waterloo Bridge, Gray Weather, 1900, Claude Monet","If not for the fog, Claude Monet once remarked, “London wouldn’t be a beautiful city. It’s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth.” While working on his London series, he rose early every day to paint Waterloo Bridge in the morning, moving on to Charing Cross Bridge at midday and in the afternoon. He observed both motifs from his fifth-floor window at the Savoy Hotel. The Art Institute’s two Waterloo Bridge paintings are dated 1900 and 1903, but both were likely begun in 1900 and dated only when Monet felt that they were finished. He worked on all of his London paintings in his studio in Giverny, refusing to send any of them to his dealer until he was satisfied with them as an ensemble.",8034.0,"Artist

"Body Cast from Pompeii, 1880, Giorgio Sommer","Giorgio Sommer was one of the most successful and well-known photographers of southern Italy in the nineteenth century, and his images served archaeologists and tourists alike. He was commissioned by Giuseppe Fiorelli, the first archaeologist to bring scientific method to the excavations at Pompeii. Under Fiorelli, archaeological evidence was to be documented at the site of its discovery, a dramatic shift from the antiquarian emphasis on aesthetics toward an anthropological appreciation of social and material context. Thus cavities created by decomposed organic matter were filled with plaster to give a more complete sense of a person’s form, and figures of Pompeians (including, in at least one remarkable case, a dog) were revealed at the moment of their deaths.",8044.0,"Artist
