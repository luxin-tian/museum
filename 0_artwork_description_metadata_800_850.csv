"Relief of a Falling Warrior, 2nd century AD, Ancient Roman","Around 435 BC, the Greek sculptor Phidias adorned the front of the shield at the side of his gold-and-ivory statue of Athena in the Parthenon with scenes of Greeks battling Amazons in the Trojan War. In Roman times, certain figures from this complex struggle were lifted out of their original context and enlarged to become decorative reliefs for the walls of a colonnade or courtyard.",800.0,"Culture

"Relief of a Falling Warrior, 2nd century AD, Ancient Roman","Here a wounded Greek warrior collapses to the ground after being struck a mortal blow from behind. The dying warrior’s noble countenance, the fillet or ribbon tied around his forehead, and his powerful, athletic body epitomize what Phidias and his pupils sought to project as the ideal of mature male dignity in the decade when Athens was at the height of its power in the eastern Mediterranean world. Some five centuries later, collectors such as the Roman emperor Hadrian sought this Phidian style, translated from a circular golden shield to a rectangular marble relief, to decorate their palaces and villas. Athenian sculptors of the Roman era made a good living creating and exporting such memories of past glories. This relief and a number of others were found near Athens in the harbor of Piraeus, where they had been lost in a disaster, likely while awaiting shipment.",800.0,"Culture

"Dorothea and Francesca, 1898, Cecilia Beaux","""It doesn’t pay to paint everybody."" With this comment, Cecilia Beaux situated herself within the rarified group of successful late-19th-century portrait painters whose clientele was primarily the upper class. This full-length depiction of two of the daughters of Helena de Kay and Richard Watson Gilder is innovative in its portrayal of spontaneous movement. The Gilders were leaders of an artistic, literary, and musical circle in New York, and they were close friends of Beaux. The girls look down, rather than at the viewer, concentrating on their dance steps. The fluid brushstrokes and use of subtle color accurately convey motion and also give the appearance of a swiftly executed canvas; however, Beaux worked diligently on the picture for over two months.",801.0,"Artist

"Painting with Troika, January 18, 1911, Vasily Kandinsky","Vasily Kandinsky, along with Franz Marc, Gabriele Münter, and Alexei Jawlensky, were members of the Blue Rider, a loose alliance of artists based in Munich. Although these artists did not have a common style, they did share a belief in the symbolic and spiritual importance of forms and colors and their effect on emotions and memories. The Blue Rider also promoted a spontaneous, intuitive approach to painting and looked to non-Western, European medieval, and folk art traditions for inspiration. In this picture, the troika, a horse-drawn sled from Kandinsky’s native Russia, and the hand-painted frame, which he made especially for this work, speak to the powerful impact of these sources on the artist.",803.0,"Artist

"Study for “Cité”: Brushstrokes Cut into Twenty Squares and Arranged by Chance, 1951, Ellsworth Kelly","The inspiration for Cité’ came to Kelly in a dream in June 1951, while he was staying at the Cité Universitaire, a large complex of buildings that included dormitories for the University of Paris. He wrote, “I dreamt that I was working on a scaffold … creating an immense mural composed of square panels on which we painted black bands with huge brushes.” [1] With the dream came an “idea for a very grand work, something to be used with architecture… . This dream is something I have been waiting for.” [2] To replicate the qualities of the dream painting, Kelly produced Study for “Cité”: Brushstrokes Cut into Twenty Squares and Arranged by Chance. Kelly brushed ink strokes across a sheet of paper, cut the resulting drawing into twenty squares, and randomly recomposed the drawing by shuffling the squares before he glued them onto a support in a grid pattern, retaining the horizontal orientation of the brushstrokes. Cité, [3] now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, replicates Study for “Cité” as a polyptych painting.",809.0,"Artist

"Spring, 1923/24, Georgia O’Keeffe","Georgia O’Keeffe and her husband, the photographer and dealer Alfred Stieglitz, often treated the same subjects in their art. In Spring, O’Keeffe painted the building that held Stieglitz’s darkroom in Lake George, New York, where the couple summered between 1919 and 1927. A comparison of Spring with a nearly contemporaneous photograph of the same subject by Stieglitz shows that O’Keeffe simplified the building by omitting the chimney, window, and horizontal siding. She also enlarged the flagpole and curved its top, emphasizing its upward thrust with the vertical format of her picture. Her cropped depiction of the building, with flowering spring trees above, differs considerably from Stieglitz’s broader horizontal view of it in the wintry Adirondack landscape.",810.0,"Artist

"Grey Diamond, 1955, Ilya Bolotowsky","A devotee of Neo-Plasticism—the geometric, nonobjective style espoused by Piet Mondrian—Ilya Bolotowsky began to include the diamond shape in his art in 1947. Bolotowsky believed that this unusual means of presentation created a more spacious composition compared to a square canvas of the same size. Grey Diamond contains many principles of Neo-Plasticism: a lack of depth, the elimination of all representational forms, and carefully balanced color. In embracing the movement, Bolotowsky explained, “Nowadays, when paintings torture the retina, when music gradually destroys the eardrum, there must, all the more, be a need for an art that searches for new ways to achieve harmony and equilibrium.”",812.0,"Artist

"Berlin Radio Tower, 1928, László Moholy-Nagy","Over the winter and spring of 1927–28, Bauhaus professor László Moholy-Nagy took a series of perhaps nine views looking down from the Berlin Radio Tower, one of the most exciting new constructions in the German capital. Moholy had already photographed the Eiffel Tower in Paris from below, looking up through the tower’s soaring girders. In Berlin, however, Moholy turned his camera around and pointed it straight down at the ground. This plunging perspective showed off the spectacular narrowness of the Radio Tower, finished in 1926, which rose vertiginously to a height of 450 feet from a base seven times smaller than that of its Parisian predecessor (which opened in 1889). Moholy attached exceptional importance to this, his boldest image: he hung it just above his name in a room devoted to his work at the Berlin showing of Film und Foto, a mammoth traveling exhibition that he had helped to prepare. Moholy also chose this view and one other to offer Julien Levy, the pioneering art dealer, when Levy visited him in Berlin in 1930. The following year the pictures went on view at the Levy Gallery in New York, in Moholy’s first solo exhibition of photographs.",816.0,"Artist

She admired the archeological site tremendously but was equally enthralled with the mountainous terrain: “The great ruin of Machu Picchu … is in the most beautiful green sheer mountains … a peak rises up above the big ruin, across the river—terraced so that I wouldn’t dream of trying to go up it—it is so sheer—the mts. were to me more wonderful than the ruin.” Peru—Machu Picchu, Morning Light conveys her awe at the sublime scenery, but O’Keeffe did not feel compelled to paint the Peruvian landscape more than a few times in her career.",817.0,"Artist

"Reclining Nude, 1929, Max Beckmann","Though often associated with the German Expressionist movement, Max Beckmann’s artistic production was highly individualistic and eludes strict categorization. While Beckmann had earlier criticized the French avant-garde, by the mid-1920s, he began to identify with artists working in the Parisian art world. He made frequent visits to the city, and his work began to show stylistic affinities with that by artists like Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Georges Rouault. Reclining Nude recalls the long-standing tradition of associating the female body with the timeless ideals of beauty. The stark nature of the model’s pose and distorted form, however, are more modern updates on this classical idea.",822.0,"Artist

Beginning with the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other Enlightenment-era thinkers, people began to view childhood as a treasured moment in human development rather than a mere step to productive adulthood. As a result, children were increasingly seen as carefree, innocent, and deserving of protection. Their nudity in art was a commonly used symbol of natural purity and vulnerability.",825.0,"Artist

Women of the upper class were encouraged to be more active in the daily lives of their children, and works in this gallery illustrate such activities as bathing, nursing, and soothing. The common use of wet nurses was increasingly discouraged, not only by male philosophers and medical doctors, but also by an emerging feminist movement. As with today’s breastfeeding advocacy, mothers in the 19th century were taught the benefits of nursing, both in terms of public health but also as a means of fostering healthy emotional and physical bonds with their children.

Referred to as a “water glass” or “sponge glass,” this device was used to stabilize the surface of moving water in order to improve visibility. Homer may have been attracted to the subject because it draws attention to the constantly moving surface of the water as well as its transparency, aspects of the sea that especially intrigued him in the Bahamas. Like The Sponge Diver (1898/99; MFA Boston), this work originally had more visible red washes in the water, hinting at the pink coral beneath the surface.

"Mr. Pointy, 2011, Takashi Murakami","Rising to prominence in the 1990s, Takashi Murakami skillfully mixes Japanese pop culture, animé, and cartoon aesthetics into a new form of global pop art. At once an artist and a businessman, his large-scale paintings and sculptures are as well known as his mass-produced trinkets and collaborations with Louis Vuitton. However, both practices disclose his persistent and tempered engagement with art-historical precedents set by Pop Art. In 2000 Murakami coined the term “superflat” to describe not only his art practice and that of his Japanese contemporaries but also a larger cultural shift toward the “extremely two-dimensional.” While this sensibility is most present in Japanese animé, Murakami asserts it is a worldwide phenomenon. According to Murakami’s own “Superflat Manifesto,” the phrase accounts for the way in which different layers of culture, especially high and low, “fuse into one.” Mr. Pointy embodies the concept of superflat. The character combines religious iconography taken from sources as diverse as Mayan culture, Tibetan Buddhism, and the Thousand-Armed Buddha (Kannon in Japanese) with a cartoon style. Mr. Pointy was devised by Murakami in 2003 and has since been repeatedly rendered in paintings, mass-market prints, and sculptures.",838.0,"Artist

Characteristic of Tang style in its robust, tapered physique, this monumental figure exhibits iconographic features distinctive to the Buddha: tightly curled hair covering a cranial mound symbolizes his enlightenment; and a forehead depression that originally held a stone or jewel represents wisdom. The articulated folds of the deity’s flowing robe integrate Indian sensuality with a distinctly Tang blend of realism and linear elegance. Capping the deity’s right shoulder, this garment discreetly modifies a fully bare-chested style described in Indian monastic texts.",844.0,"Title

"Buddha, Tang dynasty (A.D. 618–907), c. 725/50","The stepped pedestal rises from a base encircled by lotus petals pure white flowers that rise from muddy water and thereby evoke Buddhist beliefs in purity and the search for enlightenment.

"Buddha, Tang dynasty (A.D. 618–907), c. 725/50","Together with two attendant bodhisattvas in the Art Institute collection (1930.84 and 1930.85), this sculpture came to the museum in 1930 with a note of its discovery in a temple known as Cangfosi in northern Hebei province. Neither archaeological nor written records have been located to confirm this reported site. The scale and stone medium of these figures suggest that they were commissioned for a cave temple or shrine—a chamber carved into the face of a mountain or cliff.",844.0,"Title

"Julia Jackson, 1867, Julia Margaret Cameron","Julia Margaret Cameron began photographing at age 48, when her daughter and son-in-law gave her a camera for her amusement. She soon made a name for herself with large-format, often allegorical compositions and portraits that defied the conventions of Victorian photography. A typical commercial portrait of the time presented a small standing figure, sharply focused and evenly lit. By contrast, Cameron’s photograph of her niece Julia Jackson concentrates on the subject’s head, showing clearly only limited planes of her face and leaving half of it shrouded in shadow. Known as a great beauty, Jackson was a favorite subject for Cameron, who made dozens of photographs of her. In April 1867, a month before Jackson’s wedding to her first husband, Herbert Duckworth, Cameron photographed the young bride-to-be. With her hair down and eyes wide, she is unsentimental, looking forward with purpose to her own personal and social transformation.",848.0,"Artist

"Beggar with a Duffle Coat (Philosopher), 1865/67, Édouard Manet","This painting and Beggar with Oysters were probably conceived as companion pieces. Édouard Manet exhibited them together in 1872, along with paintings of an absinthe drinker and a ragpicker, under the collective title Philosophers. The beggars of Paris, nonconformist types under threat from government schemes intended to drive them out of the city, held a particular fascination for Realist artists and writers. By setting his large-scale figures against empty, dark backgrounds, Manet added to their portraitlike, indeed heroic, presence. By a remarkable coincidence, at the turn of the 20th century, these two closely related works found their way by very different means to the Art Institute’s collection.",849.0,"Artist
