"Saint John the Baptist in the Wilderness, c. 1602/03, Adam Elsheimer","Adam Elsheimer’s small paintings on copper show a remarkable ability to evoke a poetic setting for his figures. Arriving in Rome in 1600 while still in his early twenties, Elsheimer responded to the city’s antique monuments and to its extraordinary artistic ferment. In this work, painted just a few years after he settled in Rome, the woodland landscape teeming with wildlife is still indebted to the northern Mannerist tradition, while the youthful saint echoes antique sculpture in a pose that is at once vulnerable and grandiose. Though Elsheimer died tragically early after only ten years in the Eternal City, his paintings exercised a powerful influence on his fellow artists in Rome and north of the Alps.",8056.0,"Artist

"Phrosine and Mélidore, 1797, Pierre Paul Prud’hon","One of only a handful of prints firmly attributed to Pierre-Paul Prud’hon, Phrosine and Mélidore illustrates a particularly sensual scene in Gentil Bernard’s poem of the same name. After Phrosine is separated from her lover Mélidore by her jealous brothers, he becomes a hermit on a nearby island. Driven by her passion, Phrosine swims across the strait and collapses from exhaustion. Here Prud’hon depicted the moment Mélidore awakens his beloved with his warm embrace. Unfortunately for the lovers, the story ends tragically. Phrosine drowns while trying to return to the island, and overcome with despair, Mélidore takes his own life.",8063.0,"Artist

"Inland Steel Building: Model of Final Design, c. 1954/55, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill","As one of the first two high-rise buildings constructed in downtown Chicago after the Great Depression, this model represents part of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill’s push to reimagine the corporate office building, along with the Lever House in New York. The architects separated the functions of the Inland Steel Building into two towers: a 19-story office block and a 25-story service unit. As a result, the floor plans have no interior columns or partitions, allowing maximum flexibility and a bright new image of the modern office, with a green tinted-glass curtain wall and bright stainless-steel mullions.",8074.0,"Artist

"Altar Stool, Mid–/late 19th century, Yoruba","A sculptural tour-de-force, this stool was made for an altar dedicated to the deity Sango. At its center is a Sango priest—identifiable by his double-bladed staff and cape covered in cowrie shells—and a woman who reclines before him in a formal greeting. Moving clockwise, they are encircled by a man playing a drum; two women devotees, one of whom is holding a chicken for sacrifice; a rifle-toting soldier leading a bound captive; and a woman holding a large offering bowl. The motif of the soldier and captive, which also appears on the adjacent Esu dance staff by the same artist [see 1991.396], reflects the violent invasions that marked the era.",8083.0,"Culture

"Untitled, 1958/59, Elizabeth Murray","At the time Murray received her BFA from SAIC in 1962, graduating students were invited to submit a work to the fellowship competition based on a piece in the Art Institute’s collection. A painting by Bernardino Butinone, The Descent from the Cross, inspired her to create this drawing, which references Butinone’s limp, deceased Christ. Murray also made a painting, which recast the scene in a comedic way, but she failed to win the fellowship prize.",8085.0,"Artist

"The Physician Considered as God, plate one from Allegories of the Medical Profession., 1587, Hendrick Goltzius","This anonymous engraving after Hendrick Goltzius depicts a seemingly omnipotent doctor analyzing a urine flask. The two competing paths of contemporary medicine appear in the background throughout the series. On the left, a more theoretical medical doctor attends a sickbed, while on the right, a practical surgeon tends to a man with broken limbs from a fall (the accident appears through the window). The central physician figure undergoes a transformation in plates two through four, progressing from an angel (when his patient improves slightly), to a man (when he has nearly cured his charge), and finally to a devil (when he proposes his fee).",8088.0,"Artist

"The Witches’ Cauldron or Incantation, 1772, John Dixon","The Romantic painter John Hamilton Mortimer etched a series of Shakespearean heads in the mode of Thomas Frye’s Life-Sized Heads. However, this encounter between a powerful, aged sorceress and a terrified maiden has no literary source. Mortimer invented it himself, possibly responding to a critic’s assertion that Shakespeare was the only English genius who could successfully depict the preternatural realm. Dixon published another theatrical mezzotint that same year, Mr. Garrick in Richard III.",8094.0,"Artist
