"The Holy Family with the Infant Christ Pressing the Wine of the Eucharist, 1485/1525","With its focus on the infant Christ squeezing grapes to make the Eucharistic wine, this small tapestry probably decorated a private oratory. The outer border of flowers and fruit is a later addition and is less finely woven than the holy figures and the inner border of a single pansy and rosebud.",8105.0,"Title

"Ceremonial Staff, Mid–20th century (before 1962), Tutsi","Glass beads were first imported to eastern Central Africa in the 19th century, and Tutsi artisans quickly developed expertise in making decorative beaded objects, including jewelry and regalia. This staff features spiraling lines, zigzags, and triangles; the netted beadwork tightly binds together the wooden pieces that make up each staff’s inner core. Such luxury items were popular among the Tutsi elite in the early to mid-20th century. Members of the Tutsi royal family presented these staffs to a United Nations official who supervised the 1962 referendum for independence during which Ruanda-Urundi became the separate nations of Rwanda and Burundi.

"Stemmed Kyathos (Drinking Cup), 550/525 BC, Ancient Etruscan","A unique legacy of the Etruscans is the glossy black pottery known as Bucchero ware, made from the 7th century to the late 5th century B.C. Produced for both domestic and funerary uses, Bucchero ware was popular locally and imported across the Mediterranean. The signature shiny black surface was achieved by firing the pottery in a reduced-oxygen kiln, where restricted ventilation caused the iron oxide in the coarse Tuscan clay to turn black. Before firing, the clay was burnished, or polished with a smooth stone, resulting in the sheen so sought after by potters. This sheen mimicked the gleam of bronze vessels.",8111.0,"Culture

"Degree of Ossification of a Five-Month-Old Fetus (Degré d’ossification d’un Foetus de cinq mois), 1898, Unknown","In late 1895, physicist Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen inadvertently discovered a form of radiation that exposed photographic plates; as electromagnetic waves passed through opaque materials, they left behind shadowy images. He termed them X-rays, and news of the discovery spread rapidly. For the scientific community, X-rays expanded medical possibilities, allowing doctors to see interior anatomy without surgery. For the general public, these pictures spectacularly revealed places normally invisible to the human eye and became objects of enduring fascination. This X-ray appeared on the cover of Les Rayons X, a journal of radiology, on March 5, 1898, just two years after Röntgen’s discovery. The accompanying article claimed that X-rays were ""interesting and useful for the study of fetal development at all stages of pregnancy,"" describing in wonderment what can be seen clearly in the image (larger bones and the spine) and what cannot (connective tissue and cartilage).",8127.0,"Artist

"Building, 1910, John Marin","Here Marin created a compelling celebration of monumental architecture in a small format. He stationed himself in Central Park, facing the Plaza Hotel, and selected a true watercolor paper that would hold up to heavy applications of water and pigment. He did not rely on an initial pencil drawing, but instead worked quickly and loosely, tamping his brush repeatedly to capture the effect created by the hotel’s hundreds of shimmering windows. Leaving many areas of the paper white to show through his varied marks, Marin approximated the way the eye might move rapidly across such a scene. Later he attached an extra strip of paper along the bottom edge to denote activity on the street, making the Plaza seem more distant and emphasizing its height.",8130.0,"Artist
