"Top Story of a Tower  (Tomb Model), Eastern Han dynasty (A.D.25–220)","As burial practices filtered down from the Han aristocracy to officials and landowners, tomb models related to farming, an honored occupation, became increasingly popular. These models provide rough but lively impressions of rural compounds. The granary, used to store millet, barley, and wheat, was depicted either as a jar or as a small building. This building combines realistic and imaginative details: angular brackets support a tiled roof with ridgepoles and roundels and crowned with an oversize bird and floral roof ends.",8152.0,"Title

"The Diversion of the Euphrates, from The Story of Cyrus, c. 1670, Michiel Coxcie, I","The Latin inscriptions in the center of the upper border of this and the neighboring tapestry make clear that they illustrate the story of Cyrus the Great, ruler of the Medes and the Persians. Here he oversees the laborious work of diverting the Euphrates River, a tactic that would permit his troops to approach the city of Babylon and conquer it. These tapestries were woven from cartoons that adapted designs by the 16th-century court artist Michiel Coxie. Their rich borders, filled with garlands and putti as well as military trophies, are in a later Baroque style, while the poses of the ruler and his advisors take on a somewhat stereotypical aspect.",8154.0,"Artist

"State Halberd, 1600/10","Pole arms (staff weapons) were used not only in warfare and hunting, but also in sporting combat and ceremonies. The term refers to a family of edged weapons attached to wooden staffs. With the exception of the lance, which remained the weapon of the mounted knight, all other staff weapons were wielded by men on foot by 1600. With the development of firearms and their introduction as infantry weapons, pole arms lost their importance on the field, and from the mid-16th century, they were reserved for use in sporting contests and by princely bodyguards for ceremony and parade. The blades lent themselves to embellishment—engraving, etching, or other forms of decoration—and provided a perfect surface for the coats of arms of noble or princely families. The ceremonial use of staff weapons continues to this day with the Swiss Guards at the Vatican and Britain’s Yeomen of the Royal Guard.",8167.0,"Title

"Madonna Queen of Angels, 1518, Albrecht Dürer","In Albrecht Dürer’s richly symbolic and densely patterned woodcut, two angels hover above the Madonna and Child, preparing to crown their queen. Others celebrate the coronation by playing musical instruments. A seated cherub offers the Madonna potted lilies, a sign of her purity, while a standing angel presents grapes, a symbol of the Eucharist and Christ’s bloodshed. Like Lucas Cranach the Elder’s Eve from The Fall of Man (1962.113), Dürer’s Madonna takes center stage amongst the throng of angels and proffers her own fruit. This detail connects the Madonna, who brings eternal life through her son, Jesus, with Eve, who brings death into the world through original sin.",8188.0,"Artist

"5 Discussions in the Years 1976 to 1994, at Greenwich Street, New York City, 1976–1994, 1976/94, Ian Wilson","Ian Wilson has long focused on spoken dialogue as his artistic practice. “All art is information and
communication,” he once explained. “I present oral communication as an object… . I’ve chosen to speak rather than sculpt.” In 1968 Wilson began making work from the fleeting medium of conversation by staging series of verbal engagements over time with friends or other artists. These “Discussions”—which tend to start with an open-ended philosophical question—are meant to exist in the moment of dialogue only, with certificates like the ones installed here serving as the sole records. 5 Discussions in the Years 1976 to 1994, at Greenwich Street, New York City marks each occasion of a decades-spanning dialogue between Wilson and the American abstract painter Robert Ryman.",8192.0,"Artist

"Water Lily Pond, 1917/19, Claude Monet","During World War I, after several years of inactivity because of bad health and grief over the death of his second wife, Claude Monet embarked on a period of intense work. Building a large studio and improving his garden, he began a group of monumental paintings of water lilies that he would later offer to the French state. Alongside this project, he painted a suite of 19 smaller canvases, including the present one. There is evidence—including a few photographs of the artist working in his garden—that Monet conceived these paintings outdoors and then reworked them in his studio. By this last stage of his career, however, the distinction between observation and memory in his work is intangible, and perhaps even irrelevant.",8194.0,"Artist

"Bonbonnière, 1938, Margret Craver","Trained in the Arts and Crafts tradition of metalworking, Margaret Craver was nonetheless influenced by instructors at Michigan’s Cranbrook Academy of Art, mid-20th-century America’s premier design center. As a result, she created handcrafted hollowware and jewelry out of traditional materials such as sterling silver and enamel, yet she imbued her dynamic pieces with colorful, energetic patterns. In this work, Craver married the smooth surfaces, decorative flourishes, and exquisite workmanship of Scandinavian design with the unified geometry of Art Deco decoration.",8197.0,"Artist
