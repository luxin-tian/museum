"Tapestry (Bear Hunt and Falconry from a Hunts Series), c. 1525","This scene, the center section of a larger tapestry, depicts the dramatic pursuit of a bear, with falconers conducting a much tamer hunt in the background. Enthusiasm for hunting was widespread among the European aristocracy, and this popular pastime was a common subject for late medieval tapestries. Hunting was not simply a diversion for the privileged, but was also fundamental to the education of a nobleman, testing his intellectual and physical prowess. Hunts, which often took place over several days, were social occasion for both men and women. The women were often spectators, as this tapestry shows.",8203.0,"Title

"Bob Colacello, August 1973, Andy Warhol","In the early 1970s, at the height of his fame, Andy Warhol began producing staged Polaroid portraits of celebrities, friends, and casual acquaintances, many of them studies for his commissioned silkscreen prints and paintings. His tool of choice was a Polaroid Big Shot, an instant film camera fitted with a fixed focal length that made it ideal for portraiture. Warhol often took multiple photographs of his subjects in order to capture their behavioral nuances. The tightly cropped format and a camera-mounted flash reduced features to flat planes and abstract shapes, making the images perfect for use in the silkscreen process. The sitter featured here, Bob Colacello, writer and former editor of Warhol’s Interview magazine, recalled that the artist tried to convince him to change his name to Bob Cola, as this ""pop"" reference would lend itself to fame.",8208.0,"Artist

"Still Life with Currency, 1895, Charles Alfred Meurer","Born in Germany and raised in Ohio, Charles Alfred Meurer began painting hyperrealistic, or trompe l’oeil, compositions like Still Life with Currency after seeing examples of the illusionistic genre by fellow American artist William Michael Harnett in the 1880s. Meurer exactingly rendered a set of metal, wax, and paper objects against a wooden panel, complete with graining, gouges, and a prominent splinter that secures a newspaper fragment. Legible in the clipping is the phrase “Counterfeiters Caught,” a humorous comment on the artist’s own skills of verisimilitude.",8217.0,"Artist

"Tah-Bo-Ho-Ya, 1898, Elbridge Ayer Burbank","In 1897 the Chicago artist Elbridge Ayer Burbank traveled west on behalf of his uncle, the philanthropist Edward E. Ayer, to paint a portrait of the famed Apache chief Geronimo, who was then living in captivity at Fort Sill in the Oklahoma territory. During his subsequent travels throughout the West, Burbank depicted individuals from numerous Native American tribes in ethnographic portraits, nevertheless focusing a sensitive artistic eye on his sitters. Like Hermon Atkins MacNeil before him, Burbank witnessed the Hopi Snake Dance in Arizona and followed the dance’s nine-day progress, ultimately producing more than 19 paintings of the participants. The Art Institute owns eight of these portraits. Each element of paint and dress carries a specific meaning in Burbank’s portraits. In his depictions of the Hopi priests Ko-Pe-Ley and Ho-Mo-Vi, for example, the black paint on the upper parts of their faces represents heavy rain clouds, and the white around their mouths stands for purity and faith. Eagle feathers, used in the ceremony to soothe the snakes, adorn their hair. Thus costumed, the priests would have removed the snakes from a special bag and placed the reptiles crosswise in their mouths. Despite his slightly loose brushwork, Burbank carefully depicted the priests’ ceremonial garb, giving his images anthropological authenticity as well as aesthetic power. He inscribed each portrait with the sitter’s name and tribal affiliation, using ""Moqui,"" an obsolete term for the Hopi people that is now considered offensive.",8218.0,"Artist

"Sultry Night, 1939, Grant Wood","Grant Wood studied at the SAIC between 1913 and 1916. Between 1937 and 1941, he created 19 lithographs that were published by Associated American Artist (A.A.A.), a private gallery and publisher. A.A.A had a unique approach to marketing, offering printed images of American life in large editions (usually 250 prints) at reasonable prices via mail order and through regional stores such as Marshall Field’s in Chicago.
This lithograph gained notoriety for its full-frontal portrayal of a nude man; the U.S. Post Office banned A.A.A. from mailing the print because it was considered obscene. As a result, only 100 impressions were made.",8220.0,"Artist

"Spring Arriving in the Han Palace, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), 1717, Yuan Jiang","Yuan Jiang is most renowned for his meticulous “ruled-line painting” (jiehua) of architecture—the only pictorial style to utilize carpentry tools along with the flexible brush. A master of composition as well as draftsmanship, Yuan seamlessly constructed buildings within landscapes of imposing grandeur and unexpected drama. This aristocratic villa and its surrounding garden of large, diagonally swept trees and huge, eroded rocks lies beneath distant mountain ranges that emerge and recede above a thick mist. Within this animated and dreamlike setting, figures in the foreground library, on the veranda, and in the surrounding garden appear isolated in their own tranquility. Such strikingly panoramic but personally accessible images were typically commissioned by affluent individuals of late imperial China for display in the spacious reception halls of their private mansions.",8221.0,"Artist

"Landscape with Three Gabled Cottages Beside a Road, 1650, Rembrandt van Rijn","Perhaps the most prolific etcher in history, Rembrandt van Rijn created nearly 300 etchings. Most of his landscape etchings were done in the 1640s, with a few, such as this one, executed in the early 1650s. Rembrandt used his experimental etched and drypoint lines to create tonal effects that are notably looser than those of the more tightly controlled Schelte Adams Bolswert. The way that the trees appear to shade the road and cottages adds a calming luminosity to the image.",8248.0,"Artist
