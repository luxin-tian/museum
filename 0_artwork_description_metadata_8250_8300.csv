"Landscape with Three Gabled Cottages Beside a Road, 1650, Rembrandt van Rijn","Perhaps the most prolific etcher in history, Rembrandt van Rijn created nearly 300 etchings. Most of his landscape etchings were done in the 1640s, with a few, such as this one, executed in the early 1650s. Rembrandt used his experimental etched and drypoint lines to create tonal effects that are notably looser than those of the more tightly controlled Schelte Adams Bolswert. The way that the trees appear to shade the road and cottages adds a calming luminosity to the image.",8255.0,"Artist

"Tombeau de la chrétienne. Vue du côté nord. (Tomb of the Christian Woman. View of the North Side.), 1855, John Beasly Greene","Documenting archeological sites in Egypt and Algeria, John Beasly Greene produced fewer than 350 images in a mere four years (he died on his third trip to Egypt at the age of twenty-four). Greene’s twin pursuits of photography and archeology matched the larger 18th- and 19th-century penchant for memorializing lost civilizations through the wonders of modern technology. From the photographer Gustave Le Gray, Greene learned the newly perfected waxed-paper negative (a salted paper print technique), a process that was relatively easy to use in the field and which offered good tonal range as well as detail. In December 1855, he joined a French expedition to Algeria as the official photographer for the excavation of the Tomb of the Christian Woman, located outside Algiers. His pictures of the burial mound are enigmatic, focusing on the overall form of the structure rather than on particular archeological details.",8265.0,"Artist

"Figure (Mbulu Ngulu), Late 19th/early 20th century, Kota","Such flat, abstracted figures made of wood and brass were originally attached to baskets or bark boxes and served as guardians of the enclosed ancestral relics—typically the skulls and other bones of important men within the clan. Around 1930, the creation of these reliquary guardian figures ceased in response to the spread of Christianity throughout the region. Many sculptures were destroyed in the accompanying social upheaval.",8268.0,"Culture

"Bolshevism Brings War, Unemployment and Starvation, 1918, Julius Ussy Engelhard","Unlike Max Beckmann’s and Otto Dix’s antinationalist imagery, Julius Engelhard’s work defends a conservative nationalism by warning of its greatest threat, the specter of Communism. Inspired by the Soviet Revolution in Russia, left-wing activists mobilized in many German cities, making the case that only revolution could bring an end to the unholy alliance of politicians, aristocrats, and industrialists that had brought on the brutal war. In reaction to this, Engelhard’s monster (ironically playing off the image of the Hun in British and American propaganda) signaled central icons of right-wing paranoia, including the bomb of the anarchist.",8272.0,"Artist

"Mandarin Ducks and Lotus, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), 1892, Ren Yi","Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called Shanghai School. Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This painting represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.",8274.0,"Artist

"Mandarin Ducks and Lotus, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), 1892, Ren Yi","Although his inscription states that Ren Yi executed this work in the winter “with a frozen ink stone,” he clearly depicted an early summer scene. Four large lotus leaves, brushed with wet-ink washes, overpower a pair of young, delicate blossoms. The aquatic lotus emerges with pristine beauty from murky water and thereby carries enduring associations with Buddhist beliefs in purity and rebirth. Above the lotus, partially camouflaged by wind-swept reeds, swims a pair of mandarin ducks—traditional symbols of marital bliss and fidelity. Painted with sharp, quick brush strokes, this engaging depiction of the young couple suggests an intimacy appropriate for lifelong partners.",8274.0,"Artist

"The Stag Hunt, c. 1506, Lucas Cranach, the Elder","As the court artist of Elector Frederick of Saxony, Lucas Cranach the Elder had the privilege of depicting the courtly entertainment of the stag hunt. Cranach was renowned for his depictions of hunting trophies in illusionistic trompe l’oeil murals; his contemporaries even claimed that his animal imagery was so lifelike that birds tried to land on the painted stags’ antlers. The grand scale of this two-part woodcut allowed Cranach to include copious details of the deer and dogs; the visible seam in the center demonstrates that the printing shop was not necessarily interested in matching the sides perfectly.",8276.0,"Artist

"Three Captives, c. 1505, Jacopo de’ Barbari","Jacopo de’ Barbari was an Italian painter and printmaker active in the courts of Saxony, in present-day Germany, during the early 16th century. Albrecht Dürer met Barbari in Venice and was reportedly fascinated by Barbari’s idiosyncratic approach to human proportions, which led to Dürer’s own treatise on the subject (published in 1528). For this engraving Barbari depicted the three bound nude male figures each in a different pose, showing either the front, side, or back. Artists often adopted this conceit in order to prove their mastery of the body in three dimensions. Here, the figures’ languid, somewhat attenuated physiques evidence the prolonged length of their captivity.",8286.0,"Artist

It was the first of three identical suites made by Tiffany and Company, as indicated on each piece by the “No. 1” stamped on the underside.

The handles on the punch bowl portray Dionysus, the god of wine, and the wine coolers depict facemasks of Silenus, a woodland god and Dionysus’s constant companion. The full-figure, chased plaques on the wine coolers represent Agriculture and Commerce and were meant to symbolize the continued stability and prosperity of the United States after the Civil War.",8288.0,"Artist

"Fragment of a Grave Monument, 4th/3rd century BC, Ancient Greek","When this object came to the Art Institute, it was cracked in two. Experts even questioned whether the fragments belonged together, as they were misaligned and of different colors. Upon examination, it was found that the two parts were joined by lead dowels that had caused the skewed alignment, and that they were, in fact, a perfect match. The discoloration was caused by weathering that had occurred while the object lay buried in different areas of iron-rich soil. After removing the lead dowels, the two fragments were cleaned using high-pressure steam and both synthetic and paper-based poultices. Conservators created a special fill made of paper, resin, and marble dust to craft a seamless join. The pieces were then joined with an adhesive before filling in the crack and associated losses.",8297.0,"Culture
