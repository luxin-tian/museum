"Real Time: Sweepers Clock, 2010, Maarten Baas","Laced with dry wit and humor, the Sweepers Clock is arguably the most labor-intensive of Dutch designer Maarten Baas’s 2009 series of timepieces. As the name suggests, the clock features two people with brooms pushing lines of debris in real time to form minute and hour hands. This work draws our attention to how the perception of time is dictated by regularly occurring activities, as well as to the fruitlessness of hard labor.",8309.0,"Artist

"Combat Between Giaour and Pasha, 1827, Eugène Delacroix","The success of Lord Byron’s 1813 poem “The Giaour” fanned the flames of Orientalism in art and literature. Eugène Delacroix produced a painting as well as this print immortalizing Byron’s giaour, or “nonbeliever,” who falls in love with Leila, a member of a Turkish harem. This heady mix of Eastern and Western passions and beliefs has a predictably bad ending. After her master fatally throws Leila into the sea (an accepted punishment for adulterous women), her lover kills him before retreating to a monastery in remorse.",8314.0,"Artist

"The Meeting of Jacob and Rebecca, and Isaac Blessing Jacob, from The Story of Jacob, 1560/68, Jan van Tiegen","In the foreground of this tapestry based on the biblical story of Jacob and Esau, Rebecca advises her favorite son Jacob, clad in a star-adorned cloak, how to steal the birthright that belongs to his twin brother, Esau. The two young goats standing in the foreground were requested by Rebecca so she might cook a meal for Jacob to offer Isaac in exchange for the birthright. The scene in the right background shows the blind Isaac lying in bed and blessing the kneeling Jacob, having mistaken him for Esau. Rebecca stands nearby, holding a platter of goat meat. In the left background, Esau hunts with his dogs, unaware of the plot against him. All episodes shown are based on Genesis 27:2–29. The story of Jacob was a common subject for tapestry series; various Jacob suites were woven by Brussels and Flemish weavers in the 16th century.",8315.0,"Artist

"Hall Chair, c. 1900, Charles Rohlfs","The son of a New York cabinetmaker, Charles Rohlfs spent his early years working as a designer of cast-iron stoves and furnaces while pursuing an acting career in his spare time. In 1884 he married the novelist Anna Katharine Greene and moved with her to Buffalo, where he took up woodworking after being unable to afford high-quality furniture. What began as a personal venture had become a commercial endeavor by 1898. The first of Rohlfs’s exhibitions to receive national attention was held at Chicago’s Marshall Field and Company department store. Among the many items for sale was a hall chair similar to this example, which calls to mind the dramatically attenuated furniture of the Scottish architect-designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh.",8319.0,"Artist

"Slippers (Bata Ileke), Late 19th/early 20th century, Yoruba","When Yoruba people greet a king, they say, “May the crown rest long on your head, may shoes remain long on your feet.” For ritual and state occasions, a Yoruba king dresses from head to toe in elaborate beaded and cloth garments. Beaded shoes probably became part of a king’s regalia in the 18th or early 19th century, as European-inspired fashions gained prestige for many Africans. The faces on these shoes suggest the all-seeing powers of a divine king, who is guided by orisa (deities) and ancestors.",8323.0,"Culture

"Two Bulls Fighting, n.d., Paulus Potter","Paulus Potter enjoyed great popularity as an animal painter and etcher. Other contemporary artists, like Aelbert Cuyp, also specialized in animals, and few Baroque Dutch landscapes were devoid of livestock. Yet Potter demonstrated his particularly close observation of the beasts—hooves, shaggy fur, limpid eyes, and all. Like his most famous painting, a lifesize portrait of a prize bull, this etching celebrates the fighting bulls’ physicality. Potter’s career was brilliant, but brief, for he died of tuberculosis before he turned 30.",8335.0,"Artist

"The Stag Hunt, from Pastoral Hunting Scenes, c. 1775, Workshop of Léonard Roby","Part of an Aubusson set depicting peaceful hunting episodes, this tapestry illustrates a stag hunt in an autumn landscape. The scene is based on an engraving titled The Hunt in the Italian Manner (La chasse à l’italienne) by Jacques-Philippe Lebas (1707–1783), which was itself engraved after a painting by the 17th-century Dutch painter Philips Wouwerman (1619–1668). The series contained at least five other scenes: Falconers Resting, Departure for the Hunt, The Heron Hunt, The Fortunate Hunter, and a final scene that remains unknown. The delicate imagery and fragile style of the series epitomize the idealized depiction of everyday events that was so popular with the upper class and thus dominated 18th-century French art. This manner, now known as Regency or Rococo, emerged around 1690 to 1700. It was promulgated by artists who aimed to break with tradition, as the contemporary name for the style—goût moderne, or goût du temps—reveals.",8344.0,"Artist

"The Condemnation to Death, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",8345.0,"Artist

A barmaid distributes refreshments outside a tavern named the Sign of the Cross, musicians lead the procession, and people skate and sled on the frozen ice, giving the scene a general atmosphere of revelry and mirth.
