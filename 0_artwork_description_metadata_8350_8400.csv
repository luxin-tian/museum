"The Stag Hunt, from Pastoral Hunting Scenes, c. 1775, Workshop of Léonard Roby","Part of an Aubusson set depicting peaceful hunting episodes, this tapestry illustrates a stag hunt in an autumn landscape. The scene is based on an engraving titled The Hunt in the Italian Manner (La chasse à l’italienne) by Jacques-Philippe Lebas (1707–1783), which was itself engraved after a painting by the 17th-century Dutch painter Philips Wouwerman (1619–1668). The series contained at least five other scenes: Falconers Resting, Departure for the Hunt, The Heron Hunt, The Fortunate Hunter, and a final scene that remains unknown. The delicate imagery and fragile style of the series epitomize the idealized depiction of everyday events that was so popular with the upper class and thus dominated 18th-century French art. This manner, now known as Regency or Rococo, emerged around 1690 to 1700. It was promulgated by artists who aimed to break with tradition, as the contemporary name for the style—goût moderne, or goût du temps—reveals.",8352.0,"Artist

"The Condemnation to Death, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",8353.0,"Artist

"Green Suit, 1959, Jim Dine","In late-1950s New York, Jim Dine was a key early practitioner of Happenings—antic, loosely scripted, multidisciplinary performance events. He was painting avidly as well, often incorporating personal, domestic objects into both his canvases and his performances. In Green Suit, thought to be Dine’s first sculpture, the paint-daubed object itself takes precedent. Indeed, this was not just any found object, but clothing taken from the artist’s own closet. The suit’s trousers are shredded into strips, some of them suggestively bundled. Painted cardboard stands in for a shirt and tie. If in his performance work Dine made use of his body, in this assemblage he offered up the trappings of a slack, nearly two-dimensional “everyman,” untidy and poignant, anonymous yet familiar.",8357.0,"Artist

"Jianghan Lu, Wuhan, 1995, Thomas Struth","Thomas Struth has become known for a variety of series—empty cityscapes, tangled jungles, studies of museum-goers looking at art, psychologically charged portraits—characterized by large-format clarity and seeming objectivity. Originally trained as a painter (he studied with Gerhard Richter), he was one of a notable group of students mentored in photography by Berndt and Hilla Becher at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. Between 1995 and 2002, Struth visited China four times, fascinated by that country’s historic landscapes and busy city streets. Whereas his earlier black and white photographs of cities were rigorously centered and eerily devoid of inhabitants, this photograph of a bustling Wuhan market is chaotically dense, colorful, and filled with people. Printed at a scale to rival painting, it prompts us to consider the historical roles of painting and photography alike, perhaps especially in a global and digital society.",8370.0,"Artist

"Chair, 1815/20, Unknown","This chair is an elegant example of the style of furniture made during the quarter century following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. During this period it was thought that a citizen’s principal duty was to live a quiet life: the home became a sanctuary where domestic values and family-centered activities were elevated and cherished. These virtues were exemplified in the popular press by a comic fictional character whose name, Biedermeier, eventually came to identify the period and its art. Biedermeier style began in courtly and aristocratic circles before becoming popular with the newly prosperous middle classes.",8386.0,"Artist

"Chicago Installation, 2003, Wolfgang Tillmans","Wolfgang Tillmans’s photographic installations— in conjunction with the magazines, artist’s books, and postcards that disseminate his work—challenge conventional ideas of photography and the way it is exhibited. Tillmans often juxtaposes unframed images of varying sizes and formats, placing inkjet prints alongside glossy chromogenic prints, and recombining material from prior installations with new work. As the artist explained, “half my work is in the photograph, and half is in the installation.” This configuration, designed specifically for the Art Institute, presents a selection of images taken between 1993 and 2003, intermingling ephemeral moments of contemporary life with abstract studies of surface textures. Tillmans subverts traditional photographic hierarchies by focusing on complex interrelationships between images and the materiality of photographic objects. In many respects, the artist chooses to spatialize the aesthetic of a magazine or book layout on the wall.",8398.0,"Artist
