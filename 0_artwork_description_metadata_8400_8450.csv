"Crucifixion (Round), 1519, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer engraved this Crucifixion scene on a small golden plate, which likely decorated the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian’s hat or sword hilt. The backward letters INRI (identifying Christ as the so-called King of the Jews) and the switched placement of Mary and John suggest that this impression was pulled from such a plate, the image appearing in reverse as a result of the printing process. Considering the softness of precious metals, gold plates were primarily intended as jewelry rather than as printing matrices. Dürer’s early training with his goldsmith father likely influenced his skill with the burin, especially on this minute scale.",8402.0,"Artist

"Jane Avril, 1899, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec","This poster was Lautrec’s last image of Avril. With her arms raised in a playful surrender, the dancer yields to an appliquéd snake, whose coils wrap around her slender black dress.
Her twisted body might seem exaggerated, but it could have been prompted by Avril’s performances. As the poet Arthur Symons recalled, “She was so thin and supple that she could turn over backward…until she brushed the floor with her shoulders.”",8415.0,"Artist

"The Bogeyman, 1973, Duane Stephen Michals","Duane Michals is a pioneer of the staged fine art photograph, in which he uses sequencing and incorporated text to construct a narrative. His orchestrated fictions engage recurring, universal themes: sex, death, love, fear, and violence. This sequence illustrates the bogeyman, a creature that provokes nighttime fears in children everywhere, in a tale that hints at deeper psychological and metaphysical questions as well.",8418.0,"Artist

"Walking Hourglass (Color), 1989, Laurie Simmons","For decades Laurie Simmons has staged photographs and films with human surrogates: paper dolls, finger puppets, ventriloquists’ dummies, and most recently masked dancers, all “living objects” peopling a dollhouse world riven by longing, regret, and crises of identity. Her lushly colored photographs echo advertising in their evident staging and appeal, but their homemade nature undoes the slickness of commercial imagery, while their exaggerated objectification of women prompts consciousness of the very real gender inequalities that drive the image spectacle governing our daily lives. For the series Walking and Lying Objects (1987–91), Simmons hybridized a female doll figure with a ladies’ handbag, a toilet, a camera, a gun, various sweets, and an hourglass, as seen here.",8419.0,"Artist

"Pole Vault (Pryzhok s shestom), 1936, Aleksandr Mikhailovich Rodchenko","Initially trained as painter and graphic designer, the Russian artist Alexander Rodchenko was inspired to turn to photography by German Dadaist collage. As a member of the Productivist group in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution, he sought to make art that was socially and politically useful rather than purely theoretical or formal. Rodchenko believed his photographs of industrial urban environments, known for their dramatic angles and extreme close-ups, could revolutionize the way people saw the world, thereby helping to usher in the new era of the communist state.",8423.0,"Artist

"“Mayday” Lamp, 1998, Konstantin Grcic","Konstantin Grcic’s Mayday Lamp exemplifies the industrial designer’s aspirations to rethink conventional products for the home. This portable lamp is probably his best-known work to date and was realized with the Italian design company Flos. A practical rendition of an industrial lamp made for domestic use, Mayday Lamp was born out of Grcic’s dissatisfaction with contemporary lighting solutions. His love of Formula 1 racing, specifically the no-frills lamps employed by auto mechanics, served as a source of inspiration. Portable, funnel-shaped, and equipped with a hook that enables them to be secured under the hood of a car, these safety lamps provided the basis for Mayday. The large hook crowning the top of the lamp is functional, but it also acts as a decorative element in the uncluttered design.",8428.0,"Artist

"The Rape of a Sabine Woman, View from Behind, c. 1598, Jan Harmensz. Muller","Jan Harmensz Muller produced a series of masterful engravings from three different vantage points after wax models for Adriaen de Vries’s sculpture The Rape of a Sabine Woman. When de Vries cast his sculpture around 1620, long after Muller produced his prints, he replicated the style of antique bronzes. Muller’s series highlights both his engraving skill and his ability to mimic sculpture in the round. The twists and turns of conflicting male and female bodies, from the ancient story in which Roman soldiers abducted brides en masse, showcase his talent.",8433.0,"Artist

"Carnival Graces, 1943, Marvin Dorwart Cone","The circus was a popular subject for many American artists because it combined the exotic with the simple pleasures of the heartland. Based on Cone’s 1935 painting The Side Show, this drawing depicts three African American women performing for a predominantly white, male audience. Although the leg of a fourth woman can be found at the far the right, the work’s title alludes to the Three Graces, the Greek goddesses of charm and beauty. The purpose of the sideshow, and the content of the barker’s pitch to the crowd, remain ambiguous. The voyeuristic crowd ogles the beautiful women, who must have been alluringly unfamiliar in such small rural towns.",8435.0,"Artist
