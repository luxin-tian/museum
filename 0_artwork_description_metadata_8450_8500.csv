"Qur’an Stand (Marufaa), Early/mid–20th century, Swahili","Among the distinctive traits of Swahili culture is the production of finely crafted props for reading and studying the Qur’an. These objects have been made for scribes, wealthy merchants, and their families. Swahili Qur’an stands, used to hold the holy book as it is read and studied, range from simple to exceedingly ornate. Like many, this well-worn example is made of two pieces of wood that are hinged together, opening into an X-shaped cradle. It features decorative shaping at the legs, notched embellishment along the upper edges, and incised floral and geometric patterns that are reminiscent of embroidery.",8461.0,"Culture

"Mirror, 2nd century AD, Ancient Roman","Artemis (the Roman Diana), or a Roman lady with divine fantasies, after her bath in a rustic, woodland setting, is the subject of the tondo in relief on the back of this Roman hand mirror. Her cloak is draped over the rocks on which she sits, and she holds the end wrapped around a small hand mirror in her raised left hand, a divine celebration of the uses of the mirror in a Roman household. The landscape in front of her, to the right, recalls the paintings and reliefs from houses around the Bay of Naples before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. The quiver of the goddess leans against the base of a garlanded altar with a small herm on top. A second terminal figure, Priapis, the god of gardens and fertility, tilts back while facing to the right on the ledge at the right. The bovine skull in the right foreground suggests the sacrifice after a successful hunt.",8466.0,"Culture

"NO, 2003, Sharon Lockhart","Since the late 1990s, Los Angeles–based artist Sharon Lockhart has become widely known for her visually reductive, rigorously conceptual films. As a student, she was drawn to the work of Chantal Ackerman, Yvonne Rainer, Michael Snow, and Andy Warhol because of the way these artists negotiated the stasis of the photographic image with the narrative flow of cinema. Although candid in appearance, her films slowly reveal themselves to be the result of elaborate preparation and extensive collaboration with her subjects.
Filmed in a continuous take with a fixed-angle camera, NO captures Masa and Yoko Ito, a Japanese farming couple, systematically mulching a plot of land. For over half an hour, they arrange tidy piles of straw and then disperse them over a field with minimalist, almost sculptural precision. Lockhart presents, documentary-style, a temporal sequence of events, but the film resists any clear narrative. Viewers share in a sense of discovery by watching the performance, yet they are actually being offered a sort of hyper-reality: the artist creates expectations that do not seem to correspond to the disproportionate attention she has paid to her mundane subject. Lockhart described her process in the following way: “I organized NO around the optics of seeing … I had the farmers make piles of hay in the reverse perspective of the camera, following the camera’s field of vision… . After working from background to foreground to make the piles, the farmers come in and slowly spread the hay over just that portion of the field revealed by the camera, from foreground to background, as if they are covering a canvas.” As the figures move through horizontal fields of color in a choreographed fashion, Lockhart’s film appears almost as a living landscape painting.
This work is inspired by No-no ikebana, a freestyle form of Japanese flower arranging. The practice is based upon the cycles and rules of agriculture, using fruits and vegetables directly from the farm. As Lockhart has explained, “It highlights a relationship to nature and farming that is somewhat contrary to the overly mechanized large-scale agribusiness prevalent in the United States.”",8472.0,"Artist

"The Settling of the West, March 1931/September 1932, Mildred Jacobs Chappell","In her representation of the settling of the American West, Mildred Jacobs Chappell depicted European American settlers on foot, on horseback, and in covered wagons, as well as explorers and Native Americans. This peaceful and picturesque vision gives no indication of the conflict, violence, and grievous misdeeds, such as the Indian REmoval Act and Trail of Tears, that characterized the United State’s westward expansion. In an inscription on the reverse, Chappell nostalgically wrote, ""My only regret is that I could not have lived one hundred years earlier to experience those stirring times."" She thus acknowledges her historical remove from the events depicted; indeed, earlier in the inscription she admits that her love for the Old West came from history and books, which at the time would have offered an idealized narrative. The stylized forms and orderly composition, in which white settlers take center stage, reinforce the simplified and romanticized narrative presented in the quilt.",8473.0,"Artist

By 1827 he had made his way to Philadelphia where he painted seven known portraits, among them Woman with a Book and Man with a Pen. In these works Holman substituted a brilliant, tasseled curtain for a plain background. He showed his sitters in painted ""fancy"" chairs, with broad, Greek Revival crest rails, similar to painted furniture made in Philadelphia or Baltimore. Like Ammi Phillips, Holman used props that pointed to the sitters’ erudition; he also concentrated on the details of his sitters’ costumes, showing women with rings and earrings and men with stickpins fastened to cravats.",8487.0,"Artist

Elevation Showing the Group of Buildings Constituting the Proposed Civic Center., 1909, Daniel Hudson Burnham","Although only portions were put into effect, the 1909 Plan of Chicago remains one of the largest and most compre- hensive proposals for the transformation of an American city. One central aspect of the plan was a large civic center intended for an area just west of the Chicago River. Modeled on the monuments and boulevards of 19th-century Paris and Daniel Burnham’s Court of Honor at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, the complex features a tall domed building, reflecting pool, and large public square. Ultimately unrealized, Burnham’s plan imagined the Civic Center as secular temple that would serve to unify the citizens of this growing modern metropolis at a time of labor strikes and civic unrest around the country.",8488.0,"Artist
