"Aureus (Coin) Portraying Empress Julia Domna, AD 196/211, issued by Septimius, Ancient Roman","Julia Domna was the wife of the Emperor Septimius Severus and the mother of Caracalla and Geta. This coin was issued during the joint reign of Severus and his elder son. As the self-assured portrait on this coin suggests, Julia’s influence was openly recognized by contemporaries. Intellectual, ambitious, and steel-willed, the Syrian-born Julia was called ""the philosopher"". The figure of Piety on the reverse is a standard type, invoking the traditional Roman attitude of respect and duty toward one’s family, country, and gods.",8502.0,"Culture

"Bowl with Lioness, 12th/13th century, Islamic","This bowl belongs to a group of ceramics from 12th and 13th-century Iran known as Garrus ware. The name Garrus refers to a district in northwest Iran where these ceramics were excavated. Although these wares were found in Garrus, their exact origin of production is unknown. However, as with many modern-day appellations, these ceramics continue to be referred to as Garrus ware. The wares are united by a distinctive decorative technique: the decorative elements are incised on the surface of the object and set against slip backgrounds that are removed to showcase their central motifs against darker areas of color. On this bowl, a lioness has been incised on the interior with scrolling floral motifs showcased against an exposed dark red background.",8511.0,"Culture

"Untitled loose page from the Filmer Album, 1863–1868, Lady Mary Georgiana Filmer","In Victorian England, aristocratic women produced new meanings for photographs by cutting them up and pasting them into elaborate watercolor scenes. Lady Filmer employed photocollage to bolster her position in society. Here she placed herself at the heart of a gathering of fashionably attired friends and family, making a photocollage album—that is, performing the very activity that produced this work. The composition revolves around Filmer’s most important guest: Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, with whom she certainly flirted and may even have had an affair. The prince is shown leaning against the table, his hat at a rakish angle and waistline trimmed flatteringly by Lady Filmer’s knife. By contrast, her husband, Sir Edmund Filmer, is shown in the lower right—near the family dog.",8515.0,"Artist

"Shiloh National Military Park, Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee, 1978, William Eggleston","Since the early 1960s, William Eggleston has pursued a straightforward approach to common subjects and everyday life through his use of the so called snapshot aesthetic. He is best known, however, as a pioneer of color photography, which he took up later that decade “I had wanted to see a lot of things in color because the world is in color,” he explained. Importantly, Eggleston’s photographs of his hometown of Memphis, the small towns of the Mississippi Delta, and other places in the American South make vivid the ordinary or otherwise overlooked by offering them up as symbols of American culture. This image was taken at Shiloh National Military Park, site of one of the Civil War’s bloodiest battles, which took place April 6–7, 1862.",8517.0,"Artist

"Beyrouth, 2001, Joshua Mosley","Joshua Mosley’s stunning, often cryptic work, which involves a labor-intensive combination of drawing, high-definition video, photography, and sculpted stop-motion figures, has redirected the leading edge of animation technology away from its origins in collective production models and commercial applications, and into the visionary realm of the individual artist and the fine-art short film.
In Beyrouth, Mosley depicts an imaginary philosophical debate between his Lebanese grandfather, represented by a twelve-year-old boy in braids, and his great-grandfather, portrayed as a white donkey. The piece has its origins in a libretto that was inspired by the artist’s conversations with his grandfather, an etching by Francisco de Goya featuring a donkey, and English translations of short stories by the Argentine writer Julio Cortázar. Mosley wrote his libretto in English, translated it into Spanish, back into English, and finally into Arabic. Like much of his work, including A Vue and dread, Beyrouth explores the behavioral rules of conversation and the structure of dialogue. In this case, the libretto developed into an operatic soundtrack created in collaboration with composer Toufic Farroukh and inserted within the enigmatic, dreamlike film.",8527.0,"Artist

"Black Pride Whitewashed, 1971, Norman Parish","Norman Parish promoted voices from the African diaspora throughout his career while also working as a longtime gallerist. Over the course of forty years in Chicago, Parish developed, and became best known for his “stylized realism” approach to his subject matter.
After graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Parish was one of the artists who contributed to the Great Wall of Respect, a public mural at East 43rd Street and South Langley Avenue (1967–71). He completed his contribution to the mural, only to have it painted over by his peers who, responding to his fine-art training, felt that the work was too “westernized.” Black Pride Whitewashed is Parish’s record of his excised portraits of political figures H. Rap Brown, Stokely Carmichael, Marcus Garvey, Adam Clayton Powell, and Malcolm X. It was originally part of a diptych; the second panel (later destroyed by the artist) showed the same view after his work had been whitewashed over.",8530.0,"Artist

"Pectoral Disk (Akrafokonmu or Awisiado), Probably late 1920s, Asante","Gold ornaments indicate status and wealth among the Asante and other Akan-speaking peoples in coastal and central Ghana. They are worn ostentatiously at public festivals by titleholders, chiefs, and kings. The production of such ornaments declined in 1896, when British colonialists exiled the Asante king Prempeh I, but revived when he returned to Ghana in 1924. The size and artistry of this pectoral disk suggest that it was made after Prempeh I’s restoration to the throne.",8542.0,"Culture

"Headdress for Efe Gelede, Late 19th/early 20th century, Yoruba","The painted surface of this haunting mask suggests it was made for the nighttime performance (Efe) that precedes Gelede’s daytime spectacle. The light-colored paint would have made the mask easier to see in the dark. Efe lasts until dawn and includes a series of masked characters, culminating with the appearance of Efe, a grand figure who speaks with the authority of the Great Mother. The event uses songs, poetry, and satire to entertain Our Mothers—female elders, ancestors, and deities—and the community; underlying this, however, is the serious work of prayer and the invoking of spiritual forces, whose proximity is increased by the mystery of night.",8544.0,"Culture

"Flask in the Shape of a Date, 1st century AD, Ancient Roman","Initially affordable only among the wealthy, glass was used in ancient Rome as containers for oils, perfume, and tablewares. The variety of glass-making techniques reveals the changing tastes and fashions over the centuries. During the 1st century AD, cast glass was a novel form that was a luxury for the Roman household, but by the end of the century, the innovation of blown glass allowed for less labor-intensive and less expensive production, which meant people of lesser means could afford it. Blown glass became so popular it nearly supplanted ceramic and even bronze wares in the home.",8548.0,"Culture
