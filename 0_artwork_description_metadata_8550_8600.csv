"Tattoo Parlor, 1958, Robert Frank","Widely known as the cover image of the Rolling Stones’1972 album Exile on Main Street, this photograph was likely made not at a tattoo parlor but at Hubert’s Museum and Flea Circus, a popular dime museum near New York City’s Times Square. The central picture in the third row from the top depicts Hezekiah Trambles (or “Congo the Jungle Creep”) and was taken at Hubert’s by another famed photographer, Diane Arbus. The cover art for Exile also included photographs Frank had made on his travels for the celebrated photobook The Americans (1958), paired with shots of the band’s musicians in downtown Los Angeles in 1972. The Stones later enlisted Frank to film their American tour in support of Exile, resulting in the candid but controversial documentary Cocksucker Blues (1972).",8553.0,"Artist

"The Men’s Bath, 1496/97, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer’s Men’s Bath has been interpreted in many ways—from a humanist ode to Italian nudes to a group of portraits including three potential views of Dürer and one of his best friend, the rotund Willibald Pirckheimer. The waterline is only ankle-deep for the standing figures, while the seated pair in the foreground is more submerged; a Dürer look-alike controls the strategically placed pump. This large-scale woodcut was published shortly after a 1496 edict closed the bathhouses in Dürer’s hometown of Nuremberg, around the time of both an outbreak of syphilis and a drought. It may therefore be a protest against the edict, or perhaps a nostalgic look at idyllic bathing activities of days past.",8554.0,"Artist

"The Apostle Jean Journet, 1850, Gustave Courbet","Jean Journet was a nineteenth-century secular evangelist who traveled throughout France and Belgium preaching on behalf of the Fourier movement, a form of utopian socialism that aspired to the creation of social harmony. This portrait of Journet is surrounded by verses intended to be sung by the reader as a moralizing call to change. Courbet’s use of this format of text combined with image-more commonly found in crude, popular woodcuts-signals his solidarity with the movement and its popular roots.",8556.0,"Artist

"Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn, May 1738, William Hogarth",Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn was William Hogarth’s ardent protest against Robert Walpole’s Licensing Act of 1737. The act gave the British government the power to heavily censor theatrical productions. Sentimentalist domestic plays and Shakespeare were the only productions allowed on stage. Hogarth’s engraving shows actresses dressed as Classical deities preparing for a performance in a shabby and chaotic backstage setting. The artist critiqued the British government’s pompous attempt to whitewash the theater by juxtaposing the idealized characters the actresses will portray with the actresses’ reality.,8560.0,"Artist

"Suzanne Crying, NYC, 1985, Nan Goldin","Nan Goldin has said: ""To photograph from your own life has these components of risk and uncontrollable possibilities and subtext that you can’t impose upon photos; they come from experience."" For thirty-five years, it has been her obsession to record her world, capitalizing on photography’s potential for immediacy, emotion, and anecdote. Goldin’s pictures, however, present subjects living outside or against the conventional family life shown in typical snapshots. These photographs also bear witness to moments of utmost intimacy—lovemaking, violence, addiction, hospitalization—and to the rollercoaster of accompanying emotions. Suzanne, Crying, NYC is emblematic of her approach, and its power is all the more remarkable if we contemplate when, if ever, someone took our photograph while we cried.",8562.0,"Artist

"Brindey Road, Paddington, 1957, Roger Mayne","Roger Mayne began photographing in 1947 while studying chemistry at Oxford University, moving to London in 1954 to take pictures of its slums and street scenes. Portrait of Southam Street, a heralded body of work spanning 1956–61, vividly captures the gritty working-class street life of a West London district still reeling from World War II, and influenced generations of photographers in Great Britain. Mayne documented several other metropolitan boroughs as well, including the central London neighborhood of Paddington. Some of his most affecting pictures are of children at play, swinging on lampposts and playing football (soccer) in the street. “My reason for photographing the poor streets is that I love them, and the life in them,” he wrote. “The streets have their own kind of beauty.",8573.0,"Artist

"Commemorative Head, Probably mid–17th/mid–18th century, Edo","Benin brass-casters traditionally make commemorative heads in both terracotta and brass.

"The Baptism of Christ in the River Jordan, about 1510, Lucas van Leyden","Lucas van Leyden’s inverted staging of Christ’s baptism differs significantly from the Martin Schongauer engraving seen nearby. While Schongauer placed the important action in front of a rocky landscape, Lucas concealed it in a forest grove, instead emphasizing the onlookers and the small child at the bottom, who gestures toward Christ. Lucas often used this pictorial device to reset expectations about the subject of his prints, lingering on the costumes and characterizations in the foreground. Here, his avoidance of haloes, heavenly hosts, and the anachronistic volume consulted by Schongauer’s John turn the baptism into a more commonplace event.",8581.0,"Artist

Working in wood and metal, he made numerous and small sculptures and plaquettes as well as larger works, such as carved altars and fountains in brass. This wood sculpture invites comparison with similar figures found on the fountains designed by Peisser for the city of Nuremberg in the 1550s.

"Lion (One of a Pair, North Pedestal), 1893, Edward Kemeys","Iconic guardians of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Lions have stood at the Michigan Avenue entrance since the building’s inaugural year. The site became the museum’s permanent home at the conclusion of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, where the new structure had hosted lectures and other events for fairgoers. Modeled by Edward Kemeys, an essentially self-taught artist and the nation’s first great animalier (sculptor of animals), the lion pair was unveiled on May 10, 1894. Kemeys focused his talents on sculptural portrayals of North American wildlife, capturing such native creatures in anatomical, naturalistic detail. For the Art Institute, he modeled larger-than-life African lions, the one positioned north of the steps “on the prowl” and the lion to the south “in an attitude of defiance,” in Kemeys’s words. These behavioral distinctions are visible in the variation of head, tail, and stance. Each weighing in at more than two tons, the Lions were cast in Chicago by the American Bronze Founding Company.",8592.0,"Artist

"Table Lamp, c. 1930, Walter Von Nessen","Walter von Nessen initially received acclaim for his lighting, especially the lamps he designed for Eliel Saarinen’s Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Von Nessen became a great champion of the use of metal as an appropriate medium to capture the look and spirit of the modern age. Here the lamp’s sleek lines convey standardized, streamlined manufacturing, and its exposed hardware is characteristic of industrial fabrication. At the same time, the artist employed a silver finish and added a vertical strip of ebony along the shaft, giving the lamp a sumptuous, jewel-like quality. Meant to accompany a series of occasional tables that he created around 1930, Von Nessen’s Table Lamp beautifully illustrates America’s shift to a modern visual idiom during the 1930s.",8595.0,"Artist
