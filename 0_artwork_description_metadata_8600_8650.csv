"Sampler, 1791, Lucy Potter","This skillfully executed sampler belongs to one the most recognizable groups of samplers associated with a specific school, that of Mary Balch. Balch (1762–1831), also known as Polly, began teaching in 1782 to help support her family. During her 45 years of teaching, several distinctive styles of samplers and silk embroideries evolved at her school. The maker of this sampler was possibly Lucy Potter Fuller (1778–1864), the daughter of Joseph Potter (1739–1831) and Abigail Dunwell Potter (1750–1828), who married Joseph Field Fuller (1763–1845) in 1794.",8605.0,"Artist

"Rectangular Tureen (fu), Eastern Zhou dynasty, Spring and Autumn period (770–481 B.C.)","The lid and basin of this grain vessel are virtually identical in form; with the lid inverted, both pieces could be used as serving dishes. Its large lug handles are cast as vestiges of dragon heads with rolled snouts; smaller heads are applied to the lid. The surface design consists of flat, tessellated planes composed of rectangular units of tightly interlaced ribbons. This restrained pattern reflects a new interest in finely textured grid patterns that transformed bronze design in the sixth century B.C. The blue (azurite) and green (malachite) patina is copper corrosion, formed over centuries of burial underground.",8606.0,"Title

With this, he meant to rediscover a lost simplicity and purity in art.
In the 1790s, Flaxman produced a series of illustrations made into engravings for the works of Homer, Aeschylus, and Dante. These proved enormously influential, earning the sculptor lasting fame.
Little of the texts was included in these editions, as Flaxman set out to tell the story through images.",8610.0,"Artist

"The Fight over the Trousers, c. 1495, Israhel van Meckenem, the younger","Here an enraged woman wielding a distaff as a weapon gains the upper hand over her husband. They are fighting over the trousers on the ground in front of them – that is, for control of the household. This scene is part of Israhel van Meckenem’s series of six prints of couples against a neutral background. It is the only one with a clear narrative and the only one in which the blank scrolls in the upper corners are replaced with imagery: the distaff, used to spin thread and emblematic of feminine pursuits, and a demon who encourages the fight. The pointed satire of domesticity in this print suggests that the other five images of couples may also be somewhat ironic.",8612.0,"Artist

"Tower of Water and Light, Century of Progress Exposition, Chicago, Illinois, Perspective, c. 1929, Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker","Beginning in 1929, the planning commission of the Century of Progress Exposition worked on developing a scheme for the fairgrounds, themes for major buildings, and a centerpiece of inspirational proportions. New York architect Ralph Walker, a member of the commission, proposed a Tower of Light and Water, which was a soaring skyscraper-scale sculpture set in a lagoon. Cascading water and the lavish use of artificial light were to add even more drama to the giant structure.
The Depression forced the commission to scale back its plans. A combination of financial doubts (the tower provided minimal rentable space) and technical uncertainties about the complex water feats forced the proposal’s demise. A structure called the Skyride was built in its place as the centerpiece of the Century of Progress. Visitors could ride the aerial gondola between the main fair ground and the Island, or climb one of the 600-ft. towers and have a spectacular view of the city.",8613.0,"Artist

"Untitled, 1935, Hans Bellmer","Across his lengthy career Hans Bellmer worked in sculpture, photography, drawing, printmaking, and writing, but his main source of fascination remained consistent: the doll. He constructed his first doll in 1933, inspired by a combination of childhood nostalgia and obscene fantasy. The result was a life-size assemblage of interchangeable body parts adorned with girlish garments and wigs. Bellmer, who had worked as a graphic designer, arguably deployed his erotic imaginings against the conventions of advertising as well as the Nazi obsession with hardened male bodies and the idealized physique. He began obsessively deconstructing, reconstructing, and photographing his doll and publishing the prints in art books and magazines. Encouraged by the Surrealists, who praised his work, Bellmer began a second doll two years later, a version of which is shown in this photograph; it can be seen as provocatively feminine and childish, or disturbingly dismembered and incomplete.",8631.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Mr. Bittermann, 1923, Otto Dix","While many of the subjects for Dix’s portraits can be identified, his watercolor portraits are often embodiments of a stereotype, providing an outlet for his critical attacks on society.

He presents us with an image of the quintessential, hardnosed profiteer: the Bitter Man, unable to see beyond the glare that clouds his vision and apparently blind to the ills he perpetuates in the economy.",8635.0,"Artist
