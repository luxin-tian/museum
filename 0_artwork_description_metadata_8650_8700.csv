"The Road To Calvary, c. 1480–90, Martin Schongauer","Martin Schongauer, a contemporary of the Master of the Housebook, produced this more durable and significantly larger engraving of Christ’s journey to his Crucifixion. The exact chronology of these very different images remains unclear. Both are horizontal to provide additional breadth for their landscape, and both place Christ and his captors centrally. But Schongauer widened the image into a panorama extending from the city of Jerusalem to Golgotha, looking forward to later Netherlandish painters, and replaced the soft meditation of the Master of the Housebook’s image with loud spectacle, as Christ’s tormentors multiply and the distance he must travel lengthens.",8656.0,"Artist

"Cow Drinking, 1680, Claes Pietersz. Bercham","Nicolaes Berchem was the most famous Dutch painter of idyllic Italian views, but he also made over 50 etchings of pastoral subjects dealing with shepherds and their animals. This mature and ambitious print (in which the cow is, in fact, not drinking, but much else seems to be happening) was made from a 1679 drawing that is now in the Dutuit Collection, Paris.",8661.0,"Artist

"Woman’s Wrapper (Adire Eleso), 1925/75, Yoruba","These two adire, or ""tie-dyed,"" textiles—both woman’s wraps or skirts—were produced by tightly sewing together parts of a cotton fabric that would resist color during an indigo dye bath. The artists used a needle and raffia strings or cotton threads, some of which are still visible, to sew the pleats together. They also employed a technique in which pebbles are sewn into the fabric to create the vibrant chain-like effect. From the early 20th century through the 1970s, adire textiles were the domestic cloth of Yoruba women, created by them and worn as skirts in urban centers such as Abeokuta and Ibadan. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, imported dyes and machine-made cotton cloth with floral patterns replaced adire as the newest fashion.

"Carma, from Cane, 2000, Martin Puryear","Jean Toomer’s Cane is regarded as the highest literary achievement of the Harlem Renaissance and a masterpiece of African American writing, a blend of fiction, poetry, and drama set alternately in rural Georgia and Washington, D.C., among other locations. Puryear first read Cane while he was teaching at Fisk University, in Nashville, his first experience living in the south. He said that he related to the point of view of a visitor “looking at what so defines blackness in America, the agricultural life of the South, the sharecropping that had grown out of slavery.” In the late 1990s Puryear was asked to contribute illustrations to a new edition of the book. About his work for the project, Puryear has commented:
The overriding issue was to work in a two-dimensional medium. To make flat images is such a departure from what I do as a sculptor. I had seldom made woodcuts since my student days. The challenge was to create a set of images that would relate together in a familial way, suggestive of the narrative but not overtly so.",8699.0,"Artist
