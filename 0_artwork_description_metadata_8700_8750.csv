"Four Children Playing, plate seven of Twelve Ornament Panels, c. 1505–15, Giovanni Antonio da Brescia","Two artists in the circle of Andrea Mantegna produced a set of twelve ornamental columns, six of which are seen here (1937.100–03; 1937.105–06), which could be combined with other prints as framing devices. In true Renaissance form, the artists infused every inch of the image with a theatrical blend of mythology and antique ornament. Cupids gleefully urinate into one another’s vases in one of Giovanni Antonio’s columns, while half-armors and the spoils of war depicted throughout reinforce the Roman love of ancient history. The masked and hybrid creatures likely derive from grotteschi designs in Emperor Nero’s sunken Domus Aurea in Rome, which had been rediscovered and excavated in the decades before these prints were made.",8701.0,"Artist

"Oscar Wilde and Whistler, 1894, Philip William May","Phil May, a friend of Roussel and a member of the Chelsea Arts Club, contributed caricatures of actors, artists, and writers to London periodicals. The bold style and sharp wit of his drawings attracted a wide following, and his illustrations were also published in book form. This caricature of Wilde and Whistler was reproduced in Phil May’s Sketch-book, which was first issued in 1895. The caption refers to Whistler’s repeated assertions that Wilde plagiarized his ideas, accusations that ended their guardedly amicable relationship in 1890.",8703.0,"Artist

"Female Torso, c. 1910, Auguste Rodin","Life drawing from the nude was an integral part of the rigorous academic training an artist might traditionally receive in Paris and other major cities in the 19th century. Only after beginning with rote copying from prints and plaster casts after the antique would qualified, usually male, students progress to the nude model. The highly finished drawings that resulted from these sessions hearken back to Classical sculpture in their definition of relief and generally demonstrate more the respective technical aptitude of these young artists than their creative potential. Paul Cézanne and Gustav Klimt’s nudes are particularly difficult to recognize as autograph, although they underline the dramatic journey made by these artists to their mature styles. Luminous in surface handling and a tendency toward allegory, Edward Burne-Jones’ sketchbook nudes are less rigorous in their anatomical detail, while Auguste Rodin’s cropped female form floats across the page as an ode to the theme of eternal feminine. Conversely, the subject of Gustave Courbet’s Model Reading exhibits partial undress rather than complete nudity in a moment of quiet introspection between her modeling sessions.",8712.0,"Artist

"Female Torso, c. 1910, Auguste Rodin","The diminishing influence of the Academy, and its advocacy of realistic painting, infused a short-lived periodical, Le nu esthètique (The aesthetic nude). Produced shortly after the emergence of photography helped nudge painting toward greater abstraction, this publication offered decoratively laid-out photographs of female, male, and child nudes in varying poses and allegorical guises, purportedly for artists to study from life. No corresponding paintings are known, but the ultimate academician Jean-Léon Gerôme’s introduction suggests its audience was intended to be a new generation of academic painters.",8712.0,"Artist

"4-1/2 Oxen, 1989, Kay Rosen","Kay Rosen uses words and letters as a means of examining the ways in which language structures knowledge— particularly in terms of awareness of self and place. Generally concerned with formal configurations of words and letters and with the gamesmanship involved in the deconstruction and reconstruction of language, her exceedingly clever, diagrammatic works consist of common phrases, poetic verse, and word plays based on synonyms and homonyms. These black-and-white paintings form a cornerstone of Rosen’s work from the late 1980s onward, reflecting an early and ongoing interest in themes such as systems and symmetry, the structure of individual letterforms, comparative structures of words, and humor.",8713.0,"Artist

"Male Figure, Early/mid–20th century, Ijo","Though the Ijo describe forest spirits as hideous and volatile, in sculpture they are rendered as invincible warriors with wide-eyed stares and bare teeth. This elongated figure may have held a weapon in its missing hand. A large medicine gourd hangs from his neck. The white and red pigments applied to its surface symbolize the contrast of coolness and aggression, respectively. Such spirit figures were placed on altars dedicated to clan war gods where rituals were performed.",8714.0,"Culture

"American Steel & Wire Company, Worcester, Mass., 1912, Herman Schervee","After completing his photography training in New York during the 1880s, Herman Schervee maintained a studio in Worcester, MA, primarily making portraits and exhibiting with the Photographers’ Club of New England. At the turn of the century, wire-making was the largest industry in the town of Worcester, and the American Steel & Wire Company the largest company. Schervee made this photograph at one of their factories, apparently fascinated by the pattern of repeating coils seen from a high vantage point. This picture hints at the machine aesthetic that would become a central interest for modernist photographers after World War I.",8723.0,"Artist

"The Men’s Bath, 1496/97, Albrecht Dürer","Albrecht Dürer’s strikingly modern woodcut of men relaxing at an open-air bath boasts deep, dark ink and a warm, creamy paper tone suited to its celebration of naked flesh. This impression looks much the way it would have when it came off Dürer’s press around 1497. While others might have been posted on walls, perhaps at bathhouses, this particular Men’s Bath appears to have largely escaped handling until close to the present day. While ostensibly a genre scene, the print may protest the Nuremberg Council’s 1496 edict forbidding the town’s residents to visit bathhouses after an outbreak of syphilis and a drought.",8725.0,"Artist

"Container Depicting Warriors, Rulers, and Winged Beings with Trophy Heads, 180 B.C./A.D. 500, Nazca","This monumental ceramic ceremonial drum or a storage container—its long crack was repaired in antiquity—displays scenes depicting military triumph. On the upper tier, composite supernatural creatures combine forms derived from predatory birds, felines, and fish, thereby manifesting the powers of the sky, earth, and sea. These otherworldly beings feast on human captives and trophy heads, emphasizing that the natural world is not only nurturing, but also dangerous. Nazca warriors also hold weapons and trophy heads, and wear similar masks and headdresses to those worn by the composite figures, signifying that the ultimate source of their military prowess is derived from the supernatural realm. A group of elaborately attired individuals witness the sacrifices of the prisoners captured in battle. Military expeditions and ceremonies were timed to the seasonal rhythms of the environment in order to stimulate the powers of the natural world upon which human societies depended.

"Four Tiles with a Figural Scene, Safavid dynasty (1501–1722), 17th century","The practice of decorating tiles with bright colors outlined in black was known as cuerda seca, which translates as “dry cord” from Spanish. Cuerda seca developed in the Islamic lands of Spain, Iran, and Central Asia at the end of the 14th century and remained popular in these regions for several centuries. The black line between colors allowed for carefully distinguished forms that otherwise might have been muddles during the firing process.These tiles are a section of a larger scene depicting the life of the epic Persian hero Bahram Gur. Here, gazelles festively play along the bank of a river as young man plays the flute and another presumably bridles a horse, of which only the nose is visible. Similar figures appear in different sets of tiles, evidence of the use of pattern books or stock images for similar scenes. The tales of Bahram Gur were popular subjects for both smaller decorative objects and long epic books, such as the lavishly decorated Khamsa of Nizami, a 16th-century manuscript created for the Mughal Emperor Akbar.",8743.0,"Title
