"The Annunciation, c. 1585, Federico Barocci","A stunning impression of Federico Barocci’s most famous print, this masterful combination of etching and engraving reproduces his altar commissioned by the Duke of Urbino for the basilica of Loreto, painted between 1582 and 1584. The plate, published by the artist and found in his studio on his death, is the only one of his to survive; it entered the Colcografia in Rome in the eighteenth century, allowing the popular image to be reissued in the present.",8768.0,"Artist

"David Playing the Harp Before Saul, c. 1508, Lucas van Leyden","According to the Book of Samuel, an “evil spirit from the Lord” plagued King Saul, making him agitated and fearful of persecution. Because music was thought to have a therapeutic effect, the king summoned the hero and warrior David, who was renowned for his skill with the harp. In this scene of intense psychological drama, David tries to soothe the troubled king. Lucas van Leyden reveals Saul’s fragile mental state by portraying him sitting stiffly hunched in a chair, tightly clenching a spear in one fist and arching his right foot over his left. David’s pleasing performances would eventually lead to him succeeding Saul as the king of Israel.",8779.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Jean-Louis Robin, c. 1810, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres","Ingres famously said that “Drawing is everything; it is all of art,” and that “Smoke itself should be expressed by a line.” His celebrated portrait drawings exemplify his devotion to pure line.
Ingres drew his portrait of Jean-Louis Robin, chief physician of the French Hospital in Rome, from the Villa Medici, the site of the French Academy in Rome, where the artist was in residence at the time. In the distance, drawn with technical precision, is Saint Peter’s Basilica.
Using only graphite, with an astonishing economy of means and in the absence of color and modeling, Ingres rendered a personality and a setting as fully realized as in any painted portrait.",8786.0,"Artist

"Brooklyn Bridge, No. 6 (Swaying), 1913, John Marin","After a stay in Europe under Alfred Stieglitz’s patronage, Marin set up his etching press at his home in New Jersey, traveling frequently to and from New York City. Inspired by the city’s growth, Marin created a series of etchings that includes seven views of the Brooklyn Bridge and four of the Woolworth Building.

"Half-Length Recumbent Male Nude Seen from the Back, c. 1590, Pietro Faccini","One of Bologna’s most original draftsman, Pietro Faccini was fascinated with the human figure. This finely modelled nude is a splendid example of Faccini’s relaxed attitude toward anatomy. Unlike his teachers, Annibale and Agostino Carracci, who advocated strict attention to correct anatomy, Faccini manipulated the figure in subtle ways to achieve a more moving result. In his dramatic representations of the human body, Faccini may be seen as bridging the gap between late Mannerism and early Baroque art.",8794.0,"Artist

"Head and Torso of a Dancing Figure, 5th–7th century","Haniwa (literally “clay rings”) were made as funerary sculptures for Japanese nobility. Unlike Chinese tomb figures, which were buried with the deceased in underground chambers, haniwa were placed on the surface of earthen grave mounds. Rows of haniwa, partially submerged in the soil for stability, outlined the sacred contours of a burial site or were set up at its front. This male figure appears to be dancing, perhaps a common event at funeral ceremonies.",8797.0,"Title
