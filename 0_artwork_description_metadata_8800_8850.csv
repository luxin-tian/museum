"Head and Torso of a Dancing Figure, 5th–7th century","Haniwa (literally “clay rings”) were made as funerary sculptures for Japanese nobility. Unlike Chinese tomb figures, which were buried with the deceased in underground chambers, haniwa were placed on the surface of earthen grave mounds. Rows of haniwa, partially submerged in the soil for stability, outlined the sacred contours of a burial site or were set up at its front. This male figure appears to be dancing, perhaps a common event at funeral ceremonies.",8801.0,"Title

"Le Mur s’en va (The wall goes away), 1969, Craig Kauffman","Craig Kauffman began exhibiting increasingly ex-perimental paintings in Los Angeles in the 1950s, evidencing a newly cool, clean-edged sensibility that would soon be called the L.A. Look. During the 1960s, Kauffman turned to acrylic plastic as the primary supporting surface for his work. Compared to a traditional, stretched canvas support, in Le Mur s’en va I the plastic support is translucent, curving over on itself like a sheet of paper, and suspended away from the wall (as well as quite close to the floor). Indeed, the work’s French title indicates the wall “leaving” or “departing.” This candy-colored painting serves as its own kind of spatial partition, simultaneously three-dimensional and ethereal.",8809.0,"Artist

"Invitation to Mr. Whistler’s “Ten O’clock”, 1885, James McNeill Whistler","On February 20, 1885, Whistler delivered the “Ten O’Clock,” an hour-long public lecture on art, to an audience composed of fashionable Londoners including artists, dealers, and members of the press. He chose the unconventional time—two hours later than most evening events—to ensure a crowd, and he enlisted the services of the theatrical producer Richard D’Oyly Carte and Carte’s manager, Helen Lenoir, to secure the venue in Piccadilly, promote the event, and sell tickets. The lecture was well received by the audience and was mostly well reviewed in the press the next day.
This professionally engraved invitation—with touches of hand coloring on the butterfly emblem—is actually more of an announcement, given that “invitees” paid to attend the lecture. Three copies of the pamphlet containing the text of the talk are exhibited in the case below.",8816.0,"Artist

"Woman with a Book, 1827/30, Jonas Welch Holman","Jonas Holman worked as a portrait painter, writer, doctor, and preacher, supporting himself through these vocations as he traveled among Baptist congregations. By 1827 he had made his way to Philadelphia where he painted seven known portraits, among them Woman with a Book and Man with a Pen. In these works Holman substituted a brilliant, tasseled curtain for a plain background. He showed his sitters in painted ""fancy"" chairs, with broad, Greek Revival crest rails, similar to painted furniture made in Philadelphia or Baltimore. Like Ammi Phillips, Holman used props that pointed to the sitters’ erudition; he also concentrated on the details of his sitters’ costumes, showing women with rings and earrings and men with stickpins fastened to cravats.",8827.0,"Artist

"Chest of Drawers, 1760/90, John Cogswell","This serpentine-front bombé chest, one of only six known, is an exceptional example of this rare form, and it has retained its original finish and brasses. Though seemingly plain in design, the bombé chest was quite complicated and costly to produce because it took an excellent craftsman to curve the drawer sides, mahogany front, and the interior dovetail joints to match the swell of the case. While most American furniture forms were derived from European sources and were disseminated throughout the colonies, some forms like the Boston bombé chest are now known to have been produced only in their specific regions.",8835.0,"Artist
