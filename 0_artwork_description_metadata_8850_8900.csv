"Amulet of a Heart, New Kingdom, Dynasty 18 (about 1550–1295 BC), Ancient Egyptian","Small-scale Egyptian figurines, known as amulets, were thought to promote health and good luck. Amulets were such an important part of Egyptian religious beliefs that they were worn by both the living and the dead. They could be mounted on rings or strung as bracelets or necklaces; and amulets in the shape of human organs were often placed in mummy wrappings near the organ they represented to ensure the well-being of the deceased in the afterlife.The human heart—the seat of the soul and memory in Egyptian belief—was represented as a jar with two small handles. Heart-shaped amulets protected the individual’s intellect and allowed the deceased to make his or her confession before the gods at the judgment of their soul.",8852.0,"Culture

"Bust of Patroclus, August 9, 1843, William Henry Fox Talbot","Like many educated and wealthy Victorians, Talbot possessed a strong grounding in the classics. This plaster cast of Patroclus, the loyal defender of Achilles—made from a marble original in the British Museum—was a favorite subject for Talbot. Besides kindly remaining still for lengthy exposures, the sculpture also offered broad modulations of light and shadow that the relatively insensitive material of the paper print could capture well in the camera. Between 1839 and 1843, Talbot made at least 47 separate images of Patroclus alone, plus several others in which the bust was an element. He also included a photograph of Patroclus in his important 1844 publication, The Pencil of Nature, a compendium of Talbot’s undertakings in photography that is also one of the earliest photo-illustrated books.",8859.0,"Artist

"The Last Supper, from The Small Passion, 1624/31, Jacques Callot","Jacques Callot’s etching series The Small Passion exemplifies the artist’s penchant for intimate detail. These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",8881.0,"Artist
