"Ploughed Field Bordered by Trees, c. 1892, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","This work shows how Degas adapted his monotype prints. First, on the printing plate, he manipulated diluted oil paint with cloth pads and coarse bristle brushes. Having transferred these textural effects to the paper, he added pastel over the monotype, lending definition to the leaves and branches of the trees.",8901.0,"Artist

"Ploughed Field Bordered by Trees, c. 1892, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","In November 1892, Degas’s monotype landscapes were the subject of an exhibition at the gallery of Paul Durand-Ruel. One critic heralded it as the “event of the season.” The show included between 24 and 26 images of this kind; the art dealer purchased them all, at the considerable price of 1000 francs each.",8901.0,"Artist

"Steer Horn Armchair, 1870/80, Artist unknown","Although furniture made from the horns of steer, elk, and deer is rooted in European tradition—it is known to have been used in 16th-century German hunting lodges—it reached the height of its popularity in America in the 1880s. Not only did chairs like this one evoke the romanticism and pioneering spirit of the American West, they also employed innovative, exotic materials that were prized during the Aesthetic movement. Lavishly upholstered, this diminutive example was most likely intended for a parlor.",8902.0,"Artist

"Twelve Poetic Immortals and Their Poems, 1850, Tamechika Reizei","為恭は、復古大和絵派の画家の中で、古典的な絵画の復興に、最も熱意を燃やした人物であった。技法を、数百年前の原画を丹念に模写することで習得し、さらに、宮廷の生活、儀式、衣裳の詳しい知識を独学で身につけた。　この絵の完成二ヶ月前に、長年希望していた官位を受けている。

"Twelve Poetic Immortals and Their Poems, 1850, Tamechika Reizei","On each of twelve panels of this pair of screens, the ﬁgure of a revered poet from Japan’s classical age is seated, set against a solid gold ground. Attired as if in a formal courtly setting, the women wear the many-layered kimono of the aristocracy of the Heian period (794-1185), while the men sport clothing and lacquered hats of various court ranks. Above each poet is a waka verse that he or she composed, brushed in masterful calligraphy of a general style contemporary with the poet’s lifetime. The relatively large number of female poets depicted may indicate that the screens were commissioned for use in women’s quarters.",8909.0,"Artist

"Twelve Poetic Immortals and Their Poems, 1850, Tamechika Reizei","Tamechika was perhaps the most earnest of the fukko yamato-e artists who revived classical Japanese painting. Learning this technique required painstaking copying of original, centuries-old works. To this, Tamechika added an extraordinary, self-taught knowledge of court life, ceremonies, and dress. Just two months before this painting was done, Tamechika attained his long-held desire of receiving a court rank himself.
On the brink of Japan’s imperial restoration, Tamechika was seen visiting the home of a top shogunal official where he was studying works of art, and ironically, was later tracked down and assassinated, at the age of 42, by proimperialists.",8909.0,"Artist

"Arthur G. Dove, 1923, Alfred Stieglitz","A trailblazing photographer who championed photography as a fine art, Alfred Stieglitz also played a key role in the development of modern art in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century. His renowned New York galleries showed photography, painting, prints, and sculpture, focusing on an important group of American painters that included Georgia O’Keeffe, John Marin, and Arthur Dove. Stieglitz made close-up, sober yet affectionate portraits of these artists. As Daniel Catton Rich, then director of the Art Institute of Chicago, put it in 1949, Stieglitz’s portraits of his fellow artists “came through a tremendous personal understanding; they are like records of deep friendships or a series of love affairs.”",8920.0,"Artist
