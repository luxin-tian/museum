"Portrait of a Woman (Martha Hess), 1781, Henry Fuseli","On a visit to Zurich, Switzerland, in 1778–79, Fuseli made several portraits of Martha Hess, a niece of the artist’s friend Johann Kaspar Lavater. Lavater eventually incorporated prints after Fuseli’s drawings of Martha and her sister into his famous Essays on Physiognomy (published 1789).
Martha was described as ethereal and inclined toward religious fanaticism, both features consistent with how Fuseli presents her. Brilliantly lit, her ecstatic face appears to be emerging from darkness. Fuseli drew almost exclusively with his left hand, as evidenced here by his hatching (closely spaced parallel lines used for shading), which moves from upper left to lower right.",8963.0,"Artist

"Orpheus and Eurydice, 1800/30, Louis Hersent","Louis Hersent was best known for his portrayals of the upper class, as well as occasional Classical subjects. While later states of this print include the title Ruben and Bala, referring to the Old Testament figure Ruben’s seduction of his father’s significantly older concubine, the scene is more mythological than biblical. The lyre suggests that the lithograph should be interpreted as an image of the young love of Orpheus, son of Apollo, and his muse, Eurydice, whose affectionate playfulness keeps him from practicing his music. Later, refusing to accept Eurydice’s tragic death, he played in vain for her soul to be released from Hades.",8983.0,"Artist

"Julius Caesar, Perpetual Dictator, from Twelve Famous Greek and Roman Men, c. 1633, Boëtius Adamsz. Bolswert","Peter Paul Rubens’s series of important Greek and Romans reflected the antiquarian culture in which he participated as a collector, as a scholar, and as an interpreter of Classical forms. Rubens’s drawing for this engraving may in fact copy an antique sculpture bust he personally owned. Julius Caesar was one of a dozen figures he selected for the series, along with other Romans such as Caesar’s assassin, Brutus, and the emperor Nero. Despite his learned appreciation for the past, Rubens misinterpreted another bust of Julius Caesar and published it as a portrait of Caesar’s contemporary the writer, orator, and politician Cicero.",8993.0,"Artist

"Wrestler, 5th–6th century","This wrestler or rikishi is wearing a simple headband and a wrestler’s harness. He stands solidly on two feet, with a hand on his hip and the other raised to show his strength. His chest is particularly barrel-shaped, harking back to the simple tube-shaped haniwa, from which more elaborate forms developed. The figure’s left foot is a recent restoration.",8997.0,"Title

"One Inch to a Foot, 1971, John Knight","Since the late 1960s, John Knight has addressed the ideologies of built and designed space, often through
existing systems of visual communication not generally associated with art making. The title phrase of
his important early work One Inch to a Foot makes obvious reference to scale notations on architectural plans. It is etched in one-inch high, Helvetica letters on the plate of a standard overhead projector; once projected, each letter measures one foot in height. Thus a representational convention of architectural plans is physically enacted, and the work carves out real space as well: the projector requires 15 feet of distance from the wall in order to execute the title statement. One Inch to a Foot is technically portable but always establishes a direct relationship to its site of installation.",8998.0,"Artist
