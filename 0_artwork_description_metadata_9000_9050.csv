"The Nativity, 1460/70, Unknown artist","This traditional Nativity scene shows the baby Jesus sleeping in a manger with the Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, shepherds, and angels around him. The Annunciation to the Shepherds appears above this scene; the shepherds are shown with their flocks beneath cherubs carrying a banner that contains the Gloria prayer. At the top and middle of the border is a medallion of God the Father, who points toward this scene; other border medallions feature the prophets. Perhaps inspired by Alesso Baldovinetti’s Nativity, this unknown artist was most likely active in Florence toward the end of the 15th century.",9005.0,"Artist

"Squash-Blossom Necklace, c. 1915, Navajo (Diné)","During the 1860s and early 1870s, Navajos (Diné) learned silversmithing from Hispanic artisans in New Mexico, and Plains Indian craftsmen whose own metalwork stemmed from Colonial sources in the eastern United States. Mexican pesos, U.S. American dollars, and ingot silver were melted down and recast in molds carved from soft volcanic tufa. Navajo silversmiths employed steel tools and punches to develop decorative patterns. Early concho belts, bow guards, bracelets, necklaces, horse headstalls, and other items of silver jewelry display massive forms and simple ornamentation. By the 1890s turquoise was increasingly used; although most turquoise was obtained from Southwestern sources, some was imported from China and Iran. Navajo silversmiths rapidly established a distinctive elegant style that has become one of the classic hallmarks of Native American art in the greater Southwest. Today, Navajo jewelry, like that of their neighboring Pueblo neighbors, exhibit much greater complexity of design and the use of diverse semiprecious stones, shell, and a variety of metals.",9010.0,"Culture

"See-Saw, Class Systems, 1968, James Rosenquist","This lithograph was created on the cusp of the radical social changes taking place in the United States during the late 1960s. The composition is dominated by the face of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley at the center. A word puzzle constructed from variations of the words upper, middle, and lower is printed on either side of the portrait as a reference to class systems. The scowling portrait of Daley and the image’s wordplay suggest the catalysts for this work—riots sparked by protests during the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, as well as race relations and the war on poverty in general.",9020.0,"Artist

"The Red Man, c. 1900, Gertrude Käsebier","One of the leading Pictorialist photographers at the turn of the century, Gertrude Käsebier was known for softly focused, often allegorical images of women and children. In 1898 she began photographing the Sioux performers in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, a popular production featuring reenactments of the fading American Old West. By the turn of the century, Native Americans had been subjected to a series of intense armed conflicts, the restriction of tribal lands, and increased cultural assimilation, and many white Americans viewed them as an endangered people and harbored romantic visions of a disappearing “noble savage.” Käsebier, who had encountered Native Americans as a child in a Colorado frontier town, believed the subject of this photograph was “the last of a hundred”; she supposedly caught him off-guard in order to capture her vision of the archetypal Native American. Influential dealer and photographer Alfred Stieglitz published this image in 1903, in the opening issue of Camera Work.",9024.0,"Artist

"Bag (Apo Ileke), Mid–20th century, Yoruba","Eye-catching beaded regalia are worn by people of political and spiritual importance in a Yoruba community. The motifs and writing on this bag tell us that it was owned by a high-ranking member of the Ogboni society, a group of male and female elders that serve as a balance to the power of the king. Olowo is a senior title in the society and Popoola Oriri is probably the title-holder’s name. The bag’s three stylized faces evoke Ogboni symbolism. Within Ogboni, the number three is said to represent the spiritual qualities of the earth and the earth’s importance in human affairs.
This bag is semicircled in shape, with an attached strap. In addition to the depiction of the three faces, the red, orange, white, and yellow beading creates a pattern depicting two flower shapes and a complex knot form on the front of the bag. Beads and the act of beading hold spiritual associations for the Yoruba. The intensity of the color, the beads’ light-reflective qualities, and the intricate designs have contributed to the high repute of Yoruba beaded work across the world.

"Solidus (Coin) of Empress Irene, 797/802, Byzantine","Portraits of important people appear on local currency all around the world. The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BC. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person—Julius Caesar—appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire.",9041.0,"Culture

"Solidus (Coin) of Empress Irene, 797/802, Byzantine","Inscriptions on coins help identify the ruler. While the front side depicted the sovereign’s portrait, the back was often used to communicate the ruler’s accomplishments or aspirations. Until Late Antiquity, portraits usually appeared in profile. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, with one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how coins are created today.",9041.0,"Culture

"Solidus (Coin) of Empress Irene, 797/802, Byzantine","Irene was one of only three female rulers to hold sole power in the 1,100-year-long history of the Byzantine Empire. This rare coin, minted during her reign, not surprisingly incorporates remarkable iconographical innovations, with every detail stressing her sole imperial authority. She is designated basilissa (empress) in the inscription, the first time this title is present in Byzantine coinage. Her image appears on both sides, representing the first imperial double portrait on a Byzantine coin. She wears a cross-surmounted crown with pendilia (pearl adornments that reach nearly to the shoulders) and a jewel-encrusted loros (a long imperial scarf) and holds in her hands the globus cruciger (cross-topped orb) and cross-topped staff—all signs of male imperial power and dominion over the Christian world.Irene left a notable mark on the male-dominated world of Byzantine politics. She came to power by blinding and exiling her son Constantine VI. Reversing her husband’s policies, she reinstituted icon veneration. Her reign also witnessed the first major challenge from the Christian West, when in the year 800 Charlemagne was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Irene’s gender was a perceived justifi-cation for this action: a woman could not be a legitimate emperor. This watershed moment initiated a controversy between the rulers of Roman Catholic Europe and those of the Byzantine Empire about rightful claims to imperial authority. Unresolved, the controversy lasted until the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453.",9041.0,"Culture

"Glaive for the Bodyguard of Emperor Maximilian II, 1564, Jörg Hopfer","Pole arms (staff weapons) were used not only in warfare and hunting, but also in sporting combat and ceremonies. The term refers to a family of edged weapons attached to wooden staffs. With the exception of the lance, which remained the weapon of the mounted knight, all other staff weapons were wielded by men on foot by 1600. With the development of firearms and their introduction as infantry weapons, pole arms lost their importance on the field, and from the mid-16th century, they were reserved for use in sporting contests and by princely bodyguards for ceremony and parade. The blades lent themselves to embellishment—engraving, etching, or other forms of decoration—and provided a perfect surface for the coats of arms of noble or princely families. The ceremonial use of staff weapons continues to this day with the Swiss Guards at the Vatican and Britain’s Yeomen of the Royal Guard.",9043.0,"Artist
