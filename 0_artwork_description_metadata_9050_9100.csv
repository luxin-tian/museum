"Portrait of Léonide Massine, April 28, 1920, Henri Matisse","Massine (1895-1979) was chosen when still in his teens by Diaghilev to become the leading male dancer and choreographer of the Ballets Russes in the company’s middle period (1914-21). Early in his career, Massine collaborated with Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie and Pablo Picasso on the 1917 ballet Parade; he worked in the same year with Leon Bakst, who designed his Les femmes de bonne humeur. One of Massine’ s enduring successes, La boutique fantasque, dates from 1919. Bakst made the first designs, exhibited here, for the set and costumes for this ballet, but they were rejected by Diaghilev who chose Andre Derain to complete the project. Matisse’s portrait of Massine was drawn during the preparation of Massine’ s ballet Le chant du Rossignol, for which Matisse designed the sets and costumes.",9050.0,"Artist

"Charger, c. 1675, Lambeth Potteries","This charger, or large plate, is an example of English delftware, a kind of tin-glazed earthenware made with techniques similar to those used to produce ceramics in the town of Delft in Holland. The scene on the charger shows the serpent compelling Eve to tempt Adam, resulting in their expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Striking visual characteristics of this dish include the speckled trunk of the tree and the fact that both Adam and Eve have similarly rounded bellies and bosoms.",9067.0,"Artist

"Charger, c. 1675, Lambeth Potteries","The charger’s color scheme, dominated by blues, yellows, and greens on a white background, is typical of English delftware of the period. The serpent, with its striped body and dragon-like face, appears ready to bite the fruit out of Eve’s outstretched left hand. The coloring of the Tree of Knowledge has a kind of storybook charm, with a green trunk and blue foliage and large yellow orbs of fruit, resembling oranges or Asian pears. It is possible that this piece was made for someone associated with the Worshipful Company of Fruiterers, one of the London guilds, whose coat of arms included a representation of Adam and Eve with the forbidden fruit.",9067.0,"Artist

Ke bowed and touched his head to the ground, daring in response to extol the Son of Heaven’s illustriously gracious beneficence, herewith making this sacrificial xu vessel. It is to be used to contribute to the wedding of the captain-in-chief’s friends. May Ke herewith morning and night make offering to his august grandfather, and may his august grandfather and deceased-father cascadingly send down on Ke many blessings, long life, and an eternal mandate to serve the Son of Heaven.
