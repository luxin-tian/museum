"Cupid and the Three Graces, 1518/19, Marcantonio Raimondi","When Raphael painted the frescoes in the garden loggia of Rome’s Villa Farnesina, he faced an unusual pictorial format. Working in the spandrels, he had to account for the nearly triangular spaces created by the arched ceiling. This engraving, a detail of the fresco, clearly demonstrates the structural obstacles of the architecture, as the numerous curved lines represent the vaulted ceiling, trim, and wall.",9104.0,"Artist

"Bottle, 4th century AD, Ancient Roman","Glass vessels were part of the luxurious domestic decoration displayed in wealthy households in both urban villas and rural estates in the later Roman and early Byzantine eras (about 300–725). Glass vessels were used for a variety of purposes, including cosmetic containers. In the kitchen and for dining, pitchers served water and wine, and small cups were used for drinking. Glass was also used for lamps to light the home.",9106.0,"Culture

"Bottle, 4th century AD, Ancient Roman","Byzantine glass craftsmen improved upon the techniques, forms, and decorative motifs they had inherited from their Roman predecessors. An imperial edict of 337 exempted glassworkers from personal taxes and attested to their relative status in society; it remained in effect for several centuries. These artisans would, in turn, pass on their craft to successive generations, including those who worked under Islamic rule after the important Byzantine provinces of Egypt, Palestine, and Syria were conquered in the seventh century.",9106.0,"Culture

"Shabti of Horu, Saite Period, Dynasty 26 (664–525 BC), Ancient Egyptian","To assure themselves a comfortable afterlife, Egyptians stocked their tombs with at least one figurine called an ushabti, who acted as a servant in the afterlife. The message carved on each of the figurines explained that if the deceased is called on to do any work in the afterlife, the ushabti will respond with “Here I am” and will do the job. Some tombs had as many as one ushabti for every day of the year and another 36 overseers to keep order. All but the poorest citizens provided themselves with some kind of funerary furnishings. Products for burial and the labor to produce them made up a large industry in Egypt.",9109.0,"Culture

"Citizen in Downtown Havana, Cuba, 1932/33, printed c. 1962, Walker Evans","Walker Evans is perhaps best known for his dispassionate photographs of the American South during the Depression. It was during a 1933 assignment in Havana, Cuba, however, that he truly honed his eye as a social documentarian. Evans was hired by Carlton Beals to illustrate his book The Crime of Cuba, a polemical work that criticized American capitalists for their contribution to the island’s economic and political collapse. In the three weeks Evans spent in Havana, he was dismayed by the cultural crisis and police repression but visually delighted by the urban crowds, street grids, advertisements, and cinema posters. “It’s still a frontier town, and half savage, forgetful and unsafe,” he noted. “I have been drunk with this new city for days.” This photograph of a Cuban man—nonchalantly dapper in a white suit and skimmer hat, calling to mind the “dandy” figure praised by nineteenth-century critic and poet Charles Baudelaire—suggests Havana streets that were overwhelmingly male but racially diverse. Although omitted from Beals’s book, this image became one of Evans’s favorites, and he featured it in his landmark 1938 Museum of Modern Art exhibition and book, American Photographs.",9110.0,"Artist

"Soundstation Radio Alarm Clock, 1996/98, Matali Crasset","As audio technology has changed rapidly over the course of the 20th century, from records and radio to the MP3, many iconic designs for audio devices have captured the public’s imagination and embodied innovation. The Soundstation radio is one of designer Matali Crasset’s early projects, produced with Philippe Starck for Thompson Multimedia. The distinctive shape of this compact clock radio departs from conventional models, with a cone-shaped speaker intended to visualize a blast of sound while also recalling the nostalgic form of the gramophone horn. Crasset’s design follows many early innovators in the 1920s and 40s who helped popularize audio equipment for the individual consumer, such as architect and industrial designer Henry Glass’s distinctive designs for the Fada Radio Company.",9112.0,"Artist

"A Dune Landscape, 1650–51, Jan van Goyen","These five drawings (1961.378-1961.382) were once bound in a small sketchbook of approximately 200 pages. Because it was light and portable, Jan van Goyen could tuck it into his pocket while walking in search of inspiration. Sketchbooks allowed the artist to quickly delineate sand dunes and architectural structures in the vicinity of his residence in The Hague and farther afield. These landscape sketches in black chalk and ink wash relate—directly and indirectly—to compositions the artist later realized in oil paintings.",9118.0,"Artist

"Alabastron (Container for Scented Oil), 1st century AD, Ancient Roman","Initially affordable only among the wealthy, glass was used in ancient Rome as containers for oils, perfume, and tablewares. The variety of glass-making techniques reveals the changing tastes and fashions over the centuries. During the 1st century A.D., cast glass was a novel form that was a luxury for the Roman household, but by the end of the century, the innovation of blown glass allowed for less labor-intensive and less expensive production, which meant people of lesser means could afford it. Blown glass became so popular it nearly supplanted ceramic and even bronze wares in the home.",9135.0,"Culture
