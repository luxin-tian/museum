"Jazz (Dress or Furnishing Fabric), 1977 (designed 1920), Sonia Delaunay-Terk","Channeling the rapid pace of modern life, Sonia Delaunay’s Jazz design includes forms suggestive of musical notes and notation. In a striking color palette of black, white, red, and gray, pointed angular forms abut smooth, short curves. These undulations puncuated by sharp diagonals produce a medley of syncopated sensations that evoke music and dance popular in the 1920s. Delaunay intended for her designs to produce vibrant juxtapositions of color when fashioned into garments and worn on bodies in motion.",9154.0,"Artists

"Fishing Equipment, 1931, Stuart Davis","The harbor and fishing industries in Gloucester, Massachusetts, attracted Stuart Davis’s attention, and he repeatedly depicted them, focusing particularly on Gloucester’s docks during the 1930s in works like Fishing Equipment. This drawing shows Davis’s linear style and his use of mainly primary colors along with black and white, both of which were typical of his work at the time.",9163.0,"Artist

"Equestrian Figure, 16th/19th century, Dogon","In the 15th century, Dogon people fleeing hostilities in their homeland—caused by slave raiders’ incursions and the expansion of Islam—migrated to the rocky Bandiagara Escarpment in present-day Mali, where they encountered the Tellem people. While the Dogon eventually expelled the Tellem from the region, the two peoples appear to have influenced each other’s sculptural styles. This horse-and-rider features the pared-down style and encrusted surface associated with sculptures made by the Tellem.",9170.0,"Culture

"Portrait of Anna Boch, 1894, Georges Lemmen","Adapting Seurat’s signature drawing method, Lemmen combined Realist and decorative techniques in this portrait of Anna Boch, a grande dame of the Belgian art scene. Born into an upper-middle-class family dedicated to music and the visual arts, Boch played the piano, organ, and violin and was a painter associated with the Belgian Neo-Impressionists. In 1885 she joined Les XX (The Twenty), a group of artists dissatisfied with the strictures of the official Salon who had decided to exhibit together, and was its sole female member. A promoter of the work of Vincent van Gogh, she bought his Red Vineyard painting in 1890, thought to be the only sale the artist made during his lifetime.",9173.0,"Artist

"Towing a Barge in the Snow, from the album The Silver World, 1790, Kitagawa Utamaro","The subtle use of various shades of gray give this print the appearance of a watercolor.

"Landscape, 1892, Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas","Although Degas’s depictions of nature are among his lesser-known works, he was a talented landscape artist, as this vibrant pastel indicates. The rich range of greens creates a velvet-like effect. Earth tones differentiate the undulating hills. The paper support, though discolored from pink to tan, still lends a sense of warmth. The pastel on this sheet covers a unique printed image made by the artist. Degas produced many color monotypes in this period. However, while some of the prints were nearly abstract, here the scene is more legible. Juxtapositions of printed and hand-applied colors show Degas’s reworking. The winding road, for instance, was scored in with a brush handle.",9194.0,"Artist

"The Adoration of the Shepherds: A Night Piece, c. 1657, Rembrandt van Rijn","Rembrandt was printing mezzotint-like prints before the medium existed. Ludwig von Siegen’s invention of mezzotint engraving may even owe something to his encounter with Rembrandt’s prints during a pivotal 1642 visit to Amsterdam. Several of Rembrandt’s works dating from the 1650s—when few were familiar with the mezzotint process—were traditionally called “dark manner” or “night pieces.” In this unusually nocturnal Adoration, tardy shepherds arouse the Holy Family. The mezzotint process was an important part of Rembrandt’s career: copies of Rembrandt’s prints were made entirely in mezzotint, occasionally his drypoint lines were refreshed using mezzotint effects, and some of his plates were finished posthumously by other hands using the method.",9196.0,"Artist
