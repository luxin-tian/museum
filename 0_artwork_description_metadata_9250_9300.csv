"Panels from a Funerary Couch (Guanchuang), Northern Wei dynasty (386–535); c. 525","These stone panels were originally assembled to enclose the back and short sides of a low, couchlike platform that held a coffin in a tomb. This “funerary couch” was probably supported along the front and back by two long stone slabs, each elevated on rectangular feet. Such a coffin platform may also have been partially enclosed in front by two stones carved to resemble gate towers, making the couch resemble the walled enclosure of a villa or a city.",9251.0,"Title

"Panels from a Funerary Couch (Guanchuang), Northern Wei dynasty (386–535); c. 525","The original order of the Art Institute stones is not certain. Their present sequence is based on their relative lengths and pictorial compositions as well as on the alignment of the iron hinges. The left and right stones—one including a bullock cart, the other a horse with decorative trappings—may each have formed one short side of the funerary couch. The two stones between them—depicting scenes of figures under canopied platforms or umbrellas (both symbols of high status)—together may have formed the back of this structure. As reconstructed, these scenes present a symmetrical composition that is bracketed at either end by figures facing inward. Such linear drawings in stone enable us to imagine the appearance of early horizontal scroll paintings.",9251.0,"Title

"Panels from a Funerary Couch (Guanchuang), Northern Wei dynasty (386–535); c. 525","Eight framed figural compositions are engraved into the inner surface of these smoothly polished stones. The figures’ proportions and clothing are characteristic of early sixth-century Chinese styles, as known from datable tomb figurines, stone carvings, and rare surviving paintings. Except for the bearded gentlemen and those wearing baggy trousers and small “official” caps, with or without projecting wings, most of these figures seem to depict women. Not all figures, however, can be clearly distinguished as to sex, since long robes with wide collars, high sashes, and flowing sleeves were worn by aristocratic men and women alike, who also shared a hairstyle of upswept side buns. These figures are grouped in stagelike settings—hills, mountains, trees and bushes with decorative foliage patterns, and windblown cloudbands—which suggest what early pictorial landscapes may have looked like.",9251.0,"Title

"St. Sebastian, 1469/74, Martin Schongauer","The opportunity it offered to show a seminude man in a contorted pose made Saint Sebastian’s martyrdom a popular subject among 15th-century artists. Here the German printmaker Martin Schongauer depicted the saint leaning serenely against a delicately rendered tree, despite the numerous arrows protruding from his body. Schongauer took an iconic, simplified approach to this common theme by barely suggesting the background landscape. Unlike his highly complex, detailed compositions such as Saint John the Evangelist on Patmos (1968.121), this print emphasizes the contrast between the graceful figure of Sebastian bound to the tree and the predominantly blank background.",9255.0,"Artist

"Tree Peonies in Full Bloom, Qing dynasty (1644–1911), dated 1911, Longyu, Empress Dowager of China","This boldly decorative painting is a significant document of Chinese-American relations. On February 17, 1913, the Empress Dowager Longyu (1868-1913) requested that it be delivered to the carriage of Mr. and Mrs. William C. Calhoun as they departed the imperial palace in Beijing. Mr. Calhoun, a Chicago attorney, had served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary (American Ambassador) to China since 1909 and witnessed the fall of the Qing dynasty to a provisional republican government, ending China’s 2000 year-old imperial system. Prince Puyi (1906-67) had ruled for three years as the Xuantong emperor, under control of his father, Prince Pu Lun, and his foster mother, Longyu. Exactly one year before the Calhouns’ farewell —on February 17, 1912—his parents authorized the young boy to abdicate his throne.",9264.0,"Artist

"Bedcover (Cockscomb, Rose Tree and Pineapple Quilt), c. 1840","The increased availability of less costly fabrics during the early 19th century expanded the appliqué quilt tradition beyond the upper classes, who were the only ones who could previously afford the expensive fabric associated with this type of textile. The popularity of appliquéd quilts started around the 1840s and continued over the next few decades. Although appliquéd quilts often used repeated patterns laid out on a grid pattern, appliqué offered the maker the freedom and ability to create narrative and pictorial images, not easily achieved in pieced quilts often made from remnants of saved fabric.",9293.0,"Title
