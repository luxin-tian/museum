"The Trogens, 1967, Gladys Nilsson","Included in the 1967 Hairy Who? exhibition at the Hyde Park Art Center, The Trogens is a rare and important early example of reverse painting on Plexiglas— a trademark of the movement. First introduced by Jim Nutt and Karl Wirsum, the approach was adopted by Nilsson, but unlike her contemporaries, she did not execute the work from finished drawings; instead she favored an improvised mode of painting. The Trogens exemplifies Nilsson’s penchant for the absurd, utilizing the human figure as exaggerated form. Reflecting her interest in the themes of hidden realities, the work recalls the iconic story of the Trojan horse from Homer’s The Odyssey, suggesting that artifice can belie true meaning and that things are not always as they appear.",9304.0,"Artist

"Shoulder Cauldron with Diagonal Basketry Pattern, A.D. 950/1150, Hohokam","Pottery making reached the Southwest from western Mexico. By A.D. 300, along the Gila and Salt rivers in the southern Arizona desert, the Hohokam people were building pithouse villages and irrigation canals, slowly changing their way of life from hunting and gathering to a more sedentary existence. They formed ceramic vessels by coiling clay rolls and finished them in the “paddle-and-anvil” technique, supporting the inside of a vessel with a smooth stone or fingers, while working the outer surface with a paddle. Red-painted linear designs appear to derive from older Southwestern basketry weaving; the diagonal pattern on this vessel is created by vertically linked, parallel lines of scrolls.",9311.0,"Culture

"Helmet (Sigi Kun), Mid-19th/mid-20th century, Bamana","The style and incised surface designs of the standing female figure at the center of this helmet suggest that it was made by a Bamana artist. Echoing those of buffalo, the framing horns fit within a visual theme that is widespread in West Africa, referencing ideas of male power, authority, and prestige. Among the Bamana and other Mande-language speakers, such helmets were called sigi kun (buffalo head) and used by hunters’ associations.",9318.0,"Culture

"Adoration of the Magi, 1450–64, printed in the 18th century","Niello work, an ancestor of engraving, originated in the workshops of goldsmiths and armorers. Designs were often engraved on silver and then dusted with niello, a powdered metallic alloy. When heated, the enamel-like amalgam fused into the engraved lines. The surface of the metal was then polished, highlighting the black design. An artist could proof his work by rubbing ink into the lines and printing the design on dampened paper. This work was once attributed to the goldsmith Maso Finiguerra (1426-1464), the most famous niellist of his day. It is now thought to be an 18th­ century production based on earlier Florentine models, but it nonetheless conveys the jewel-like quality of Finiguerra’ s art.",9324.0,"Title

"Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Nerva, 97, issued by Nerva, Ancient Roman","In A.D. 96 Emperor Domitian (r. A.D. 81–96) who fancied himself a god, was assassinated with the assent of his wife. To avert a succession battle, the Army and the Senate stepped in to choose the next ruler. From A.D. 96 to 180, Rome enjoyed a series of five wise leaders who were chosen for their merit and who came to be known as the ""Good Emperors."" Nerva (r. A.D. 96–98; no. 1), an honest and respected senator, took the throne with the understanding that he would be succeeded by a popular general from Spain named Trajan (r. A.D. 98–117). Although Nerva ruled only two years, he enacted compassionate social programs and is considered the first of the Good Emperors. For the next 85 years each emperor would select from among the best possible candidates, adopting his chosen successor as his son.",9325.0,"Culture

"Angels and Airplanes, from War: Mystical Images of War, 1914, Natalia Goncharova","In this composition, the angular geometry completed by the wings of planes and angels contrasts with the angels’ circular halos. Early in the war, aviation was used for aerial reconnaissance photography, which could perhaps explain why these airplanes lack any sign of artillery. It was not long after Natalia Goncharova made this print that the airforce began to be used for many other purposes in wartime. The pilots and angels share a celestial point of view that raises questions about the kind of knowledge required to make decisions in war.",9327.0,"Artist

"Tetradrachm (Coin) Portraying Ptolemy I, 176/175 BC, Reign of Ptolemy VI (181–145 BC), Ancient Greek","The purpose of the first portrait coins was to identify the ruler. The front side became a mirror of the sovereign’s self-image. The back was often used to communicate the ruler’s accomplishments or intentions. The profile portrait was used because it suited the very shallow depth and limited surface of the coin. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how modern coins are created today.",9340.0,"Culture
