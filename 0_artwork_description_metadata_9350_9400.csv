"Young Peasant Having Her Coffee, 1879–80, Camille Pissarro","Beloved for his Impressionist landscapes, around 1880 Pissarro turned his attention to the human figure, producing Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (on view in gallery 246, in the museum’s European painting and sculpture galleries), a monumental canvas of a humble subject, among other works. Hands and feet have gained notoriety for being the most difficult body parts to draw, and this sheet reveals the artist’s struggle to depict his subject’s hands. The painting was shown with a group of other new figure pictures at the seventh Impressionist exhibition in 1882. Exceedingly rare, this is the largest of the artist’s preparatory drawings.",9358.0,"Artist

"Florence Henri, 1927, Lucia Moholy","In 1923 Lucia Moholy, who had studied photographic technique in the previous decade, began a photography apprenticeship at the Bauhaus, where her husband, László Moholy-Nagy, had recently been appointed instructor. She quickly adopted a modernist approach focused on portraiture and architectural views. Lucia Moholy believed that the face and hands conveyed the true character of a sitter, and she made a series of portrait pairs in the 1920s isolating these two parts of the body. During her five years at the Bauhaus, Moholy also chronicled the German art school’s buildings, design products, faculty, and student body. French-American artist Florence Henri took a summer painting course at the Bauhaus, but on her return to France she abandoned her brush for the camera; Moholy photographed her several times during the course of their friendship. This close-cropped, direct portrait fits with the sobriety of the growing New Objectivity movement in photography and painting, and it echoes a vogue for close-up film stills that had just begun in Germany.

"Florence Henri, 1927, Lucia Moholy","Formally trained in reproduction photography, Lucia Moholy worked at the Bauhaus as a documentarian of its myriad productions—from architectural projects to modern design objects. With the spare aesthetic that she used in documentary photographs, Moholy also made portraits of Bauhaus students and friends, some as publicity but others, including this work, for more personal ends. Moholy often utilized plain backgrounds and preferred her subjects to be closely cropped in an asymmetrical balance. This approach is evident in her view of Florence Henri, who came to Dessau in 1927 to audit courses in painting. Henri benefited from Moholy’s expertise and the general Bauhaus proclivity toward photography; after moving to Paris, she too concentrated on camera work, especially portraiture.",9359.0,"Artist

He had bought it for 150 guineas directly from the artist’s studio, along with Wright’s Academy by Lamplight.

By the age of 24, he was a master in the Antwerp guild and was the primary artist responsible for making engravings after the work of Peter Paul Rubens. During his life, Rubens closely supervised the printmakers who reproduced his work, encouraging them to imitate his style as closely as possible. Pontius actually lived in Rubens’s house until a year after the painter’s death, at which time he went on to make engravings, such as this one, after Anthony van Dyck and other artists like Titian and Diego Velázquez.

"Gene and Nancy Bavinger House: Plan of Lower Level Showing Water Garden, 1950/51, Bruce Alonzo Goff","Inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright, architecture Bruce Goff eschewed a traditional education in architecture and went on to create some of the most original and iconoclastic designs of modern organic architecture, from futuristic drawings to complex biomorphic environments. The Bavinger House is one of Goff’s most famous projects, designed for two artists who flaunted the conventions of postwar suburbia. Goff designed the house on the model of a logarithmic spiral, a geometric progression that often appears in natural forms, including nautilus shells and galaxies. Although the design appears to be an elaborate garden in this floor plan, the spiral-shaped structure was built in rough rock masonry, sheet metal, and tension cables. The house featured a single open interior space with a series of terraced platforms suspended over a landscape of wading pools and indoor plantings. His creative exploration of natural forms and three-dimensional geometries for the Bavingers was an important milestone in Goff’s mature career.",9374.0,"Artist

"Orpheus Charming the Animals, 1490/1510, Peregrino da Casena","As early as the sixth century, Italian silversmiths used an enamel-like, black compound called niello to fill incisions in metal and make their ornamentation visible. Dark backgrounds and pronounced contours are common characteristics of niello plate designs. As paper became more readily available in the 15th century, silversmiths made impressions from the niello plates on sheets to check their progress or record their designs. Growing interest in these small pictures soon led artists to engrave plates for the sole purpose of making prints.
Mythological subjects were the most popular niello plates. This print depicts Orpheus, son of the Greek god Apollo, playing music so skillfully that he allures the beasts around him. After the death of his wife, Eurydice, he traveled to the underworld to bring her back. Although he was unsuccessful in his mission, Orpheus became one of a select few who had journeyed to hell and back. For this feat, Dante included Orpheus in the Inferno, among the other ancient poets who reside in limbo.",9383.0,"Artist

"Glaive for the Bodyguard of King of Hungry and Bohemia (Later Emperor) Maximilian II, 1563","Pole arms (staff weapons) were used not only in warfare and hunting, but also in sporting combat and ceremonies. The term refers to a family of edged weapons attached to wooden staffs. With the exception of the lance, which remained the weapon of the mounted knight, all other staff weapons were wielded by men on foot by 1600. With the development of firearms and their introduction as infantry weapons, pole arms lost their importance on the field, and from the mid-16th century, they were reserved for use in sporting contests and by princely bodyguards for ceremony and parade. The blades lent themselves to embellishment—engraving, etching, or other forms of decoration—and provided a perfect surface for the coats of arms of noble or princely families. The ceremonial use of staff weapons continues to this day with the Swiss Guards at the Vatican and Britain’s Yeomen of the Royal Guard.",9387.0,"Title

"Multitudes of Cranes, spring 1863, Bokushin","This is a striking image of a rising sun and 50 cranes flying in formation above a cloud bank. These symbols of long life were used here to honor the 50th birthday of the poet Baigyo. Called chimei, a 50th birthday was seen as a big stepping-stone in life and a halfway point to the idealized old age of 100.
The artist Bokushin is not well known today, indicating the great number of artists available to surimono publishers at this time. He may have been a poet who excelled in the visual arts.
