"A Way of Flying, from Disparates, published as plate 13 in Los Proverbios (Proverbs), 1815–17, published 1864, Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes","Near the end of his life, Francisco de Goya created a satirical series of etchings published as Los proverbios (Proverbs). The series was also known as Los disparates, meaning “nonsense” or “follies.” Although Goya often used flying as a symbol of man’s evil and vanity, this group of prints contains some of his most mysterious and complex imagery, which he intentionally left open to many interpretations.",9402.0,"Artist

"First Anti-Vietnam War March, 1967, LeRoy Henderson","After early studies in fine art, LeRoy Henderson turned to photojournalism in the 1960s, eventually contributing to magazines such as Black Enterprise, Essence, Jet, Newsweek, and New York. He shot this photograph at an antiwar protest organized by the Black United Action Front in which participants, led by civil rights activists Stokely Carmichael and Floyd McKissick, marched from Harlem to Central Park. In printed and shouted slogans such as the one seen here, marchers linked the war in Vietnam to struggles for justice at home.",9407.0,"Artist

"In a Chiaroscuro, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","Since the early 1960s, David Hockney has sought ways to meld his modern aesthetic style with highly personalized subject matter. He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.",9419.0,"Artist

"In a Chiaroscuro, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.",9419.0,"Artist

"In a Chiaroscuro, from The Blue Guitar, 1976–77, David Hockney","It is perhaps Hockney’s Blue Guitar that has perpetuated the idea that Wallace Stevens was similarly inspired by Picasso’s Old Guitarist. Although Stevens was familiar with modern art and no doubt saw the painting when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1934, he insisted that no one picture inspired his famous poem.",9419.0,"Artist

"Altar Vessel, Early/mid–20th century, Gur","Across the Gur-speaking region, individuals and families establish altars to honor and commune with influential spirits. Making altar vessels is the work of highly accomplished potters. The spikes on these vessels reflect a practice that is found across West Africa. Among the Lobi, such spikes symbolize fertility, fecundity, and protection. On this vessel, a chameleon, a symbol of wealth, stands squarely on the lid used to protect the powerful substances within from natural and supernatural contamination.

"Gunner’s Linstock (Matchholder) combined with Spear, 1600/30","Pole arms (staff weapons) were used not only in warfare and hunting, but also in sporting combat and ceremonies. The term refers to a family of edged weapons attached to wooden staffs. With the exception of the lance, which remained the weapon of the mounted knight, all other staff weapons were wielded by men on foot by 1600. With the development of firearms and their introduction as infantry weapons, pole arms lost their importance on the field, and from the mid-16th century, they were reserved for use in sporting contests and by princely bodyguards for ceremony and parade. The blades lent themselves to embellishment—engraving, etching, or other forms of decoration—and provided a perfect surface for the coats of arms of noble or princely families. The ceremonial use of staff weapons continues to this day with the Swiss Guards at the Vatican and Britain’s Yeomen of the Royal Guard.",9434.0,"Title

"The Terminal, 1893, printed 1920/39, Alfred Stieglitz","Stieglitz took this photograph in front of the Old Post Office in New York, where the Third Avenue railway system and the Madison Avenue streetcar system had their terminals. He reflected on his creation of the work 45 years later: “Naturally there was snow on the ground. A driver in a rubber coat was watering his steaming horses. There seemed to be something related to my deepest feeling in what I saw, and I decided to photograph what was within me.” For Stieglitz, who had returned from Europe to find that everyday use of the Kodak camera had supplanted serious photography, The Terminal represented new possibilities for photography and the hope for “an America in which I could breathe as a free man.”",9437.0,"Artist

"The Flight into Egypt, from the Life of the Virgin, c. 1504–05, published 1511, Albrecht Dürer","Early in his career Albrecht Dürer set out to meet Martin Schongauer but arrived after the famous printmaker’s death. This woodcut from The Life of the Virgin, one of Dürer’s three major illustrated books along with The Passion and The Apocalypse, represents an homage to Schongauer. Compared to Schongauer’s print of the scene, Dürer’s image shares an interest in a variety of exotic vegetation (palms) and desert creatures (lizards) and by suggesting the arid nature of the landscape, visually reinforces how far the family had to travel to escape the persecution of Herod’s Massacre of the Innocents.",9438.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Louis XV, 1739, Jacob Christoph Le Blon","Jacques Gautier D’Agoty worked as an apprentice in Jacob Christoph Le Blon’s Paris studio for a few weeks in 1738. After Le Blon’s death, he argued that he had improved Le Blon’s color mezzotint process by adding a fourth plate and opportunistically claimed the exclusive right to use the process, by order of Louis XV. Gautier D’Agoty also insisted that—unlike Le Blon—his prints did not rely on hand retouching or highlighting. This portrait of their mutual patron includes both a black plate and etched white highlighting in the hair. The red pigment applied to the lips has faded, and so determining whether Le Blon’s portrait seems closer to a waxed figure than Gautier D’Agoty’s anatomy studies is for the viewer to judge.",9449.0,"Artist
