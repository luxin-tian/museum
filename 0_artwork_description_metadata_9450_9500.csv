"Punch Bowl, c. 1789, Chinese export porcelain","Chinese officials limited all international trading to the city of Canton, and segregated the fan kwae (foreign devils) into a 15-acre area outside of the city wall. Decorated in grisaille, or monochrome, the exterior of this punch bowl shows the 13 trade buildings, known as hongs (foreign factories), that lined this restricted area. Each building was associated with a particular country, and they doubled as counting houses and living quarters, where agents resided during the fall trading season. In this view of the hongs, the American factory lies between those of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, suggesting that this was an early rendering, made before the United States permanently established its factory next to Sweden’s.",9451.0,"Artist

"The Singer and the Lute Player, c. 1495, Israhel van Meckenem, the younger","This engraving by Israhel van Meckenem is from a series of 12 prints that depicts amorous couples in elaborately furnished interiors. Its suggestive scene depicts a young couple eagerly anticipating a liaison—musical or otherwise. In his lap, the man holds a lute, an instrument frequently likened to the female body, and he stares intently at his companion, who pauses in reading her musical scroll to return his gaze. The small dog in chains near his feet is meant to symbolize the captivating power of music and beautiful women.",9457.0,"Artist

"Portrait of Louis XV, 1739, Jacob Christoph Le Blon","Jacques Gautier D’Agoty worked as an apprentice in Jacob Christoph Le Blon’s Paris studio for a few weeks in 1738. After Le Blon’s death, he argued that he had improved Le Blon’s color mezzotint process by adding a fourth plate and opportunistically claimed the exclusive right to use the process, by order of Louis XV. Gautier D’Agoty also insisted that—unlike Le Blon—his prints did not rely on hand retouching or highlighting. This portrait of their mutual patron includes both a black plate and etched white highlighting in the hair. The red pigment applied to the lips has faded, and so determining whether Le Blon’s portrait seems closer to a waxed figure than Gautier D’Agoty’s anatomy studies is for the viewer to judge.",9461.0,"Artist

"Chest-Over-Drawer, c. 1725, Robert Crosman","This chest belongs to a group of furniture attributed to drum maker and joiner Robert Crosman, who likely learned the furniture-making trade from family members. The piece’s simple plank construction is characteristic of Crosman’s work. Although the flat top is undecorated, a white tree with ocher leaves and red flowering buds, and four birds surround the initials ""H B"" on the central panel. Early painted chests were likely made for young women as dowry vessels. The inclusion of women’s initials on chests, as well as the use of a decorative vocabulary that bespeaks fertility and prosperity, supports this long-standing view. The initials on known Crosman chests are thought to be those of his sitters and other women in his family; the initials on this chest could be those of Hannah Blake, a relative of Crosman’s second wife.",9467.0,"Artist

"Quiet Life in a Wooded Glen, Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), dated 1361, Wang Meng","This modest cottage nestled at the foot of towering mountains presents a quintessential image of academic retreat from the “dusty” world of material concerns and political instabilities. Its cultured occupant kneels on a platform and plays the zither (qin); a book lies open before him and young servants wait attentively nearby. The luxuriant setting of layered peaks and intertwined trees, as well as the dry, charcoal- like treatment of fibrous and dotted boulders, is imbued with a textural richness. This style is closely associated with Wang Meng, the last of the “Four Great Masters” of the Yuan dynasty.",9468.0,"Artist

"Quiet Life in a Wooded Glen, Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), dated 1361, Wang Meng","Such a complex, kinetic composition reflects this artist’s distinctive contribution to the literati’s new use of painting as a vehicle for intellectual and emotional self-expression. This concept was largely kindled by social and political upheavals that accompanied the 14th-century Mongol conquest of China and the establishment of the Yuan dynasty. Wang Meng, who had served the Mongol government as a legal scribe, retired to a mountain hermitage in the turbulent final decades of Yuan rule. He may have executed this painting as a metaphorical self-portrait.",9468.0,"Artist

"Stemless Kylix (Drinking Cup), 300/200 BC, Ancient Greek","During the course of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C., black vessels (commonly called black-glaze vessels) were made with increasing frequency in both Greece and South Italy.

"Untitled (Terminal Series), 1968, Larry Bell","Since the 1960s Larry Bell’s sculpture has relied on the rectangular forms associated with Minimalism. Yet it has also consistently drawn into question the solidity and rigidity of the sculptural object. Here, as in most of his work, an empty glass cube sits on a Plexiglas plinth: this box mirrors its surroundings while at the same time allowing the viewer to look directly into and through it, to the gallery beyond. For the glass of Untitled (Terminal Series), Bell employed a vacuum-coating process, which adhered metallic layers to the panes of the cube in order to manipulate their potential to scatter and capture light. In 1968 the artist described his interest not simply in perceiving space but in creating it: “The space declared by these new sculptures becomes the work.”",9498.0,"Artist
