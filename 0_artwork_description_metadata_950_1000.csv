"Hogs Killing a Snake, c. 1930, John Steuart Curry","Along with Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry attained significant fame as one of the three most important Regionalist painters of the 1930s. In 1941 Wood wrote about Curry: “It was action he loved most to interpret: the lunge through space, the split second before the kill, the suspended moment before the storm strikes.” Hogs Killing a Snake reveals his fascination with the violence of nature and the struggle for survival. Curry deliberately constructed the dynamic composition to heighten the vitality of his subject; the hogs converge from all angles upon the writhing snake, giving a sense of violent motion. Curry accentuated the vigor of the composition with his painting technique, using short, choppy brushstrokes and even scratching on the surface of the paint to suggest the bristling hair on the hogs’ backs. Although the subject was ostensibly drawn from a childhood experience, the painting transcends mere realism to become nearly epic.",950.0,"Artist

"Milton Dictating to His Daughter, 1794, Henry Fuseli","Although the British public preferred pictures of landscapes, Henry Fuseli championed the cause of history painting—depicting subjects from the Bible, ancient and modern history, and great literature that expressed grand ideas. Seeking an audience for such images, he produced a series of paintings for an exhibition illustrating the work of the 17th-century English poet John Milton. The political and personal hardships Milton endured appealed to Fuseli and to the Romantic temper of his time. Here, in one of three paintings showing Milton’s life rather than his poetry, the blind poet, inspired by an inner light, dictates his epic poem Paradise Lost to one of his daughters.",953.0,"Artist

"The Terrace, c. 1660","In this work, an open window shaded by a grape arbor reveals couples drinking and chatting. Musical instruments, songbooks, and military gear hint at worldly pursuits and amorous dalliance, but the chief subject of the painting seems to be the illusionism of the near and far objects framed by the window. Optical problems were particularly intriguing to painters working in Delft, among them Carel Fabritius, Johannes Vermeer, and Pieter de Hooch. The author of this work has not yet been identified; one proposal is Ludolf de Jongh (1616–1679), a talented and eclectic artist from the neighboring city of Rotterdam.",954.0,"Title

"Nude on a Table, 2001, John Currin","In his depictions of the female nude, John Currin mines a number of distinct pictorial styles from art history; his figures have exhibited the frilly ruffles and peachy skin tones of French Rococo paintings, as well as the distended anatomies and distorted proportions of Northern Renaissance and early Mannerist works. The faces, makeup, and hairstyles of Currin’s women, however, are always borrowed from contemporary magazines and advertisements. Ultimately, the artist’s fusion of high and low source materials produces distinctly beautiful, often disturbing, works that are equal parts homage and parody. This painting is a direct quotation of Annibale Carracci’s Dead Christ (c. 1584; Staatsgalerie Stuttgart).",956.0,"Artist

"Armor for Field and Tournament, c. 1540/60 with later etching, Jörg T. Sorg, the Younger","The growing relationship between armor and costume in the 16th century is indicated in the delicately incised and etched center band with scalloped edge on this armor, which mimics the embroidered front closing of a contemporary male doublet (a close-fitted bodice). The particularly fine decoration of etched floral arabesques suggests the workmanship of the Augsburg armory, perhaps of Jörg T. Sorg. The elements of this armor are from the same garniture—multiple matching pieces of armor that could convert a basic suit into various field or sporting armors. Perforations on the breastplate are for bolting a shock-absorbing lance rest in place and reinforcing plate armor for sporting events. When approaching an opponent, the latch door on the helmet would be closed for protection, whereas in more casual times, the door would be opened for air circulation.",957.0,"Artist

"The Rapidity of Sleep, 1945, Yves Tanguy","This painting exemplifies Yves Tanguy’s late style, especially as he practiced it after his move to the United States in 1939, where he married the American painter Kay Sage. The forms have become harder and more sculptural, resembling strangely shaped stones, rather than the amorphous creatures of his earlier paintings, and echoing more clearly the prehistoric stones—the dolmens and menhirs—of Tanguy’s native Brittany. Color is also intensified, as the artist makes more generous use of the orange-red and blue found only spottily in earlier works, such as his 1928 screen. The arrangement, size, and shape of these forms has become more varied, from the regimented clustering of forms on the right to the horizontal scattering of forms on the left and in the background. The viewer is also brought visually closer to the scene through the cropping of forms in the foreground.
The title of the painting (inscribed on the back as La Rapidite des sommeils) works in conjunction with the image to heighten its enigma and mystery, as in the works of Giorgio de Chirico and Rene Magritte. Perhaps the title refers to the onset of sleep, or to the different stages of sleep, as the French use of the plural ""sommeils"" seems to suggest. This interpretation seems to find a visual equivalent in the progression from congested, active foreground to sparse, quiet back-ground, from the thicket of vertical forms on the right to the more relaxed rhythm of horizontal forms extending into the distance. In the middle ground, at left, is an unusual configuration that seems particularly evocative in relation to the title. A horizontal form reminiscent of a sleeping figure lies, as in a bed or coffin, within the rectangular space defined by a rocklike border. Is Tanguy referring to the sleep that ushers in the dream-world of his landscapes or to the ultimate sleep, the sleep of death? The mood of the picture hovers uncertainly between the ominous and the contemplative, between lower and upper halves, engendering a desire to traverse the inhospitable foreground to reach the soothing, misty reaches of the background. Given the date of the work, at the end of World War II, one also wonders whether there is embedded in this work something of the emotional tenor of the times, a yearning for a peace that would transcend recent history.

"Flowering Cherry and Autumn Maples with Poem Slips, 1654/81, Tosa Mitsuoki","Japanese aristocrats engaged in the elegant custom of recollecting classical poetry while viewing spring and autumn foliage. In these delicate screens, premier court painter Tosa Mitsuoki meditated on the inevitable passage of beauty by depicting the melancholy hours after the departure of reveling courtiers. A cherry tree bursts into bloom on the right screen, while its mate displays the brilliant red and gold foliage of maples in autumn. Slips of poetry, called tanzaku, waft from the blossoming limbs, the remaining evidence of a human presence. Courtiers (whose names are recorded in a seventeenth-century document) assisted Mitsuoki by inscribing the narrow strips with quotations of appropriate seasonal poetry from twelfth- and thirteenth-century anthologies. The screens were either commissioned by or given to Tofukumon’in (1607–1678), a daughter of the Tokugawa shogun who married the emperor Gomizunoo (1596–1680). In an era otherwise marked by increasing control of the feudal shogunate over imperial prerogatives, this royal couple encouraged a renaissance of courtly taste that nostalgically evoked the past glories of early-medieval aristocratic life.",963.0,"Artist

The artist’s genesis of this large canvas involved many preparatory studies, which fall primarily into two groups: small compositional sketches and color studies on wooden panels, and nuanced Conté crayon drawings that explore both the empty landscape and the shapes of specific figures or figural groups. In this contemplative drawing, Seurat developed the expressive contours of the seated female figure holding a parasol that would ultimately occupy the center of the finished painting.",965.0,"Artist

"After the Bullfight, 1873, Mary Cassatt","Mary Cassatt chose a quintessentially Spanish subject, executing this painting of a torero in full regalia during an extended stay in Seville. Having trained in Philadelphia and Paris, Cassatt ventured alone to Spain to study the country’s masters and to follow the artistic path of modern painters like Édouard Manet. Depicting the bullfighter at a relaxed moment, far removed from the spectacle and violence of the ring, Cassatt elided narrative detail. Instead, with a modernist sensibility, she focused on the male figure in a casual pose and employed vigorous brushwork and rich pigment to describe his costume. The bullfighter’s characteristic bravado nevertheless hints at flirtation with a female counterpart outside the frame.",968.0,"Artist

Beginning with the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other Enlightenment-era thinkers, people began to view childhood as a treasured moment in human development rather than a mere step to productive adulthood. As a result, children were increasingly seen as carefree, innocent, and deserving of protection. Their nudity in art was a commonly used symbol of natural purity and vulnerability.",974.0,"Artist

Women of the upper class were encouraged to be more active in the daily lives of their children, and works in this gallery illustrate such activities as bathing, nursing, and soothing. The common use of wet nurses was increasingly discouraged, not only by male philosophers and medical doctors, but also by an emerging feminist movement. As with today’s breastfeeding advocacy, mothers in the 19th century were taught the benefits of nursing, both in terms of public health but also as a means of fostering healthy emotional and physical bonds with their children.

That year the French sculptor began his preliminary sketches and clay studies for Horse, progressively abstracting these initial naturalistic renderings of the animal’s anatomy into a coiled configuration of geometric forms suggestive of pistons, gears, and shafts. Optimistically embracing the clean aesthetic and dynamic potential of the machine, Duchamp-Villon reinterpreted the traditional subject of equestrian sculpture for the modern era.

"Shower Below the Summit (Sanka hakuu), from the series “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjurokkei)”, c. 1830/33, Katsushika Hokusai","Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) is considered one of the greatest artists in Japanese history, and one of the important masters of the Japanese woodblock print. Hokusai’s most famous work is the series Fugaku sanju-rokkei (Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji), created between 1830 and 1832, when the artist was over seventy years of age. This brilliant series actually consists of forty-six views of the well-known mountain: the extra ten scenes were added by Hokusai to the initial thirty-six views. The ingenuity of artistic expression and the astonishing variety of vantage points from which Mount Fuji is viewed are a testament to Hokusai’s creativity.
Mount Fuji, known as ""Fuji-san,"" is the highest mountain in Japan, with a height of 12,385 feet. Once an active volcano, its last great eruption was in 1707. Well before Hokusai’s time, Mount Fuji had been worshipped as a sacred mountain, and in his day it was a destination for pilgrims from all over Japan.While known for his novel and dynamic compositions, Hokusai’s greatest strength was undoubtedly his remarkable draftsmanship. As a colorist, he was capable of being both bold and sensitive, and much of his success depended on his judicious combination of both exceptional drawing and dazzling color. Here, the mountain is shown with clear skies at its summit and a thunderstorm near its base. The combination of the elegant sloping sides of the volcano and the sharp, jagged lines of lightning at the bottom results in an image of great simplicity and visual force.",978.0,"Artist

"Open Window, Nice, 1928, Raoul Dufy","Raoul Dufy’s work often draws comparison with that of Henri Matisse, and the two artists indeed had a number of things in common: they both worked on the Riviera, a circumstance that led them at times to treat very similar subjects (compare, for example, Matisse’s Woman Standing at the Window of 1919, formerly in the Winterbotham Collection); they both went through a Fauvist phase and continued to give primacy to color in their subsequent work; and they both traveled to North Africa and were seduced by the lush, exotic patterns of that region. But in Dufy’s work, an extraordinary facility often masks the traces of intellectual effort and intense experimentation so apparent in the art of Matisse. The mood in Dufy’s paintings is one of unalloyed pleasure, and so unwaveringly is this mood sustained throughout his work that it has been said that ""Dufy never painted a sad picture.""
At his best, as in this superb example, Dufy displayed an unrivaled decorative sense, juggling with consummate skill broad areas of bold, saturated color (blue, red, green, yellow), a calligraphic line of great verve and fluidity, and an assured if carefree appreciation for the compositional liberties of modern painting. Dufy here brilliantly transformed the common modernist motif of the slanted, upturned tabletop (see, for example, <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/artists/33739""",981.0,"Artist

In the poem, Elaine dies of a broken heart after being spurned by Sir Lancelot; Rosenthal’s painting depicts Elaine’s postmortem voyage from Astolat to Camelot: “In her right hand the lily, in her left / The letter—all her bright hair streaming down.” Rosenthal’s artistic choices reflect the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, a group of English artists who favored highly naturalistic details, richly colored surfaces, and subjects drawn from medieval literary sources. After it was purchased by an American patron, Rosenthal’s work sparked Elaine hysteria: clubs were formed in her honor, dirges and waltzes were composed, and copies of Idylls of the King sold out in bookstores.",990.0,"Artist

"Polynesian Woman with Children, 1901, Paul Gauguin","In this painting, the young boy in the woman’s lap may be Paul Gauguin’s son, born to his Tahitian lover Pahura. The boy was named Emil after the artist’s eldest legitimate child. The older woman may be the boy’s grandmother. This composition recalls the common Christian image of the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child and young Saint John the Baptist, although here the older child is presumably a girl.",994.0,"Artist

"Leda, c. 1920, Constantin Brancusi","Sculptor Constantin Brâncusi believed the material with which he worked had its own life, a uniqueness and essence that he had to seek out in order to reveal the form contained within. In Leda, sculptural metamorphosis became the very subject of the work. According to classical mythology, the god Zeus changed into a swan in order to seduce the beautiful Leda. Brâncusi explained to visitors to his studio that he chose to transform the transformation—changing Leda, rather than Zeus, into a swan. He explained, ""I never could imagine a male being turned into a swan, impossible, but a woman, yes, quite easily."" Brâncusi envisioned the form ""ceaselessly creating a new life, a new rhythm,"" which he enhanced by its circular concrete base, a type that he designed by 1916 and used in various sizes for many different sculptures.",995.0,"Artist

"Steel-Aluminum Plain, 1969, Carl André","In 1966 Carl Andre revolutionized sculpture by pioneering works that lie flat on the ground rather than rising up and occupying space. Andre invites viewers to walk upon his sculptures so that they can register, on a sensory level, the feel of different materials (such as steel and aluminum) and the distinction between standing in the middle of a sculpture and remaining outside of its boundaries. Originally exhibited as part of a single installation entitled 37 Pieces of Work, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1970, Steel-Aluminum Plain alternates identically sized steel and aluminum plates that form a six-square-foot checkerboard pattern of subdued visual restraint.",999.0,"Artist
