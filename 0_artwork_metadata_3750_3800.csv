Jesse Timmendequas, who had been previously convicted of sex crimes involving young girls, told police that on July 29, 1994, he lured the seven-year-old into his home, across the street from the Kanka family residence, by offering to show her a puppy. The Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation, established by Megan’s family, has fought for legislation requiring sex offenders to register with local police who must then inform communities of their presence. The Hamilton Township Rotary Club tore down the house and built this park as a memorial to Megan. From the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam
