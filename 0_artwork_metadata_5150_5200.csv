Artist’s inscription: One year, 365 days, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each has 90 days. Cold winter and hot summer are the most difficult time; when it gets cold as if cutting with a knife, hot as if roasting. In spring and autumn, the weather is good, but it gets lots of rain and wind. Through the year, there is only a few days with good weather. It is difficult to come upon a beautiful scenery. If you can have a beautiful scenery and good weather, what a enjoyable thing! Do not light a tall candle which shine the zun vessel of fragrant wine. That is a empty life in the world of men. The ancient people; encouraged to have a party at night with candles. Each minute of spring night is as valuable as thousand of gold, but I say that even with the thousands of gold, you cannot bring the spring night back again. Xianggong jinshi wujun Tang yin wrote.
