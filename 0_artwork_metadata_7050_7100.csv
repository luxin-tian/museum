Signed recto, lower right, on image, in yellow pencil: ""GERTRUDE KÄSEBIER""; inscribed recto, upper right, on image [possibly on negative]; ""ALFRED STIEGLITZ / MCMVI""; inscribed verso, full page, letterpress printed in black ink [upside down]: "" I BELIEVE that here are observable the first steps, still somewhat hesitating but already significant, toward an important evolution. Art has held itself aloof from the great movement, which for half a century has engrossed all forms of human activity in profitably exploiting the natural forces that fill heaven and earth. Instead of calling to his aid the enormous forces ever ready to serve the wants of the world, as an assistance in those mechanical and unnecessarily fatiguing portions of his labor, the artist has remained true to processes which are primitive, traditional, narrow, small, egotistical, and over-scrupulous, and thus has lost the better part of his time and energy. These processes date from the days when man believed himself alone in the universe, confronted by innumerable enemies. Little by little he discovers that these innumerable enemies were but allies and mysterious slaves of man which had not been taught to serve him. Man, to-day, is on the point of realizing that everything around him begs to be allowed to come to his assistance, and is ever ready to work with him and for him, if he will but make his wishes understood. This glad message is daily spreading more widely through all the domains of human intelligence. The artist alone, moved by a sort of superannuated pride, has refused to listen to the modern voice. He reminds one of one of those unhappy solitary weavers, still to be found in remote parts of the country, who, though weighed down by the misery of poverty and useless fatigue, yet absolutely continues to weave coarse fabric by an antiquated and obsolete method, and this although but a few steps from his cabin are to be found the power of the torrent, of coal and of wind, which offer to do twenty times in one hour the work which cost him a long month of slavery, and to do it better. / It is already many years since the sun revealed to us its power to portray objects and beings more quickly and more accurately than can pencil or crayon. It seemed to work only its own way and at its own pleasure. At first man was restricted to making permanent that which the impersonal and unsympathetic light had registered. He had not yet been permitted to imbue it with thought. But to-day it sees that thought has found a fissure through which to penetrate the mystery of this anonymous force, invade it, subjugate it, animate it, and compel it to say such things as have not yet been said in all the realm of chiaroscuro, of grace, of beauty and of truth. / MAURICE MAETERLINCK""

Title
Paolo Soleri at Arcosanti, Cordes Junction, Arizona
Origin
United States
Date
Made 2000
Medium
Chromogenic print, from the series ""Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America""
Inscriptions
No markings recto or verso Throughout the twentieth century, architects have been particularly ready to offer their visions of an idealized urban future. For Le Corbusier, a “Radiant City” would be appropriate to the machine age, providing a highly efficient and organized grid to facilitate modern life. For Frank Lloyd Wright, it was critical that everyone have their own patch of earth on which to realize their individuality: thus his “Broadacre City” not only necessitated personal land to live on, but a car to get there. The Italian-born architect Paolo Soleri is far less well-known to the public than Le Corbusier or Wright, but in the Arizona desert he is quietly building what is perhaps the world’s only true prototype of a futurist city. Arcosanti is an “Arcology,” a word used by Soleri to describe the harmonious marriage of architecture and ecology. Unlike Wright, with whom he studied, Soleri believes that it is the physical dispersal in the landscape permitted by the automobile that has led to moral and spiritual dispersal in society. By contrast, Arcosanti, planned for five thousand inhabitants, will occupy only two percent of the land normally taken up by a suburban development. Residents work no more than a ten-minute walk from their homes, eliminating the need for cars within the city—consistent with Soleri’s prophecy of the eventual extinction of the automobile. Reminiscent of the historic center of Italian cities, every aspect of Arcosanti’s design, including numerous balconies, terraces and piazzas, encourages a maximum of social interaction. Soleri is also critical of excessive consumption of resources. To avoid wasting materials, gardens, solar heating and natural cooling move the community toward self-sufficiency. Arcosanti has been under construction for thirty-five years, self-funded by the sale of distinctive wind chimes and bells that are forged on site. It is being built by students and volunteers—progress is at once achingly slow and surprisingly fast. Visitors will find a substantial and unusual small community of about fifty permanent residents, and significant glimpses of a city that feels ancient and futuristic as it rises.

No markings recto or verso One of the first “green” residential developments in America, Village Homes was founded in Davis, California, in 1981 by Michael and Judy Corbett. Its continued success has demonstrated that private residential development can be ecologically sound while providing real community. Village Homes is situated in California’s Central Valley, where temperatures in excess of hundred degrees are common during the long summer season. Automobile roadways in the development are much narrower than those in typical suburban communities and only thirty-two of seventy acres contain houses, therefore the urban heat island effect is significantly reduced. Ambient air temperatures can be as much as fifteen degrees lower than those in nearby conventional neighborhoods; utility bills for air conditioning tend to be fifty percent less. The fight with the city of Davis to approve narrower streets was hard won (succeeding because of European research demonstrating that they were safer), as was the struggle for above-ground water drainage in natural swales. These are earthen embankments that hold and conserve rainwater and return it to the ground. Shortly after they were finally approved and built, the embankments’ worth was demonstrated when Village Homes was one of the few areas in Davis left undamaged by flooding after heavy rainfalls. Every aspect of the development plan of Village Homes was designed to promote community, but none more so than the shared ownership and management of gardens, orchards and vineyards, also known as “edible landscaping.” Signs notify community residents when crops are ripe. Vegetables and fruit from more than thirty varieties of trees can be picked for free. Almonds, an important cash crop, are available for purchase at a fifty percent discount to those who help in their harvest. The community’s success may be measured by a study which shows that the average Village Homes resident knows forty-two of his neighbors, as opposed to seventeen in a standard suburban development. Similarly, a typical Village Homes resident maintains that four of his or her best friends live in the neighborhood, while in a conventional community this figure is 0.4.
